In its well-known advisory opinion, the ICJ stated that there is no customary rule prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons (ICJ, 1996: 247). The Court noted that IHL applies to the use of nuclear weapons, however, the Court did not “conclude definitely whether the threat of use of nuclear weapons would be lawful or unlawful in an extreme circumstance of self-defense” (ICJ, 1996: 226). Interpreting the general principles of IHL and the Court’s positive opinion on the applicability of the rules of IHL to the use of nuclear weapons together, it is not that easy to conclude that, in principle, it is prohibited to use nuclear weapons. Probably, the concept of proportionality will be a decisive criterion in this respect."

Legally speaking, an ocean which is no more than a major body of water in between continents is also considered sea. Therefore, although the parties in an enclosed region might collectively decide the other way depending on their historical usages and/or contemporary interests, bodies of water that are connected to others via rivers are not considered sea.

    "explanation": "Finally, the right to hot pursuit entitles coastal States to exercise their jurisdiction on, and even arrest, foreign ships which violated their respective laws and regulations. This right is “designed to ensure that a vessel which has infringed the rules of a coastal state cannot escape punishment by fleeing to the high seas” (Shaw, 2008: 617). But, there are certain conditions as clearly listed in Articles 23 and 111 of the 1958 HSC and the 1982 UNCLOS respectively. First and foremost, a foreign ship must have violated the laws, regulations and rights put into force for the protection of the zone in question. Therefore, the coastal State would have extensive rights on foreign ships in the territorial sea, the pursuit may be commenced within the contiguous zone only if the laws and regulations of the coastal State concerning customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary issues are violated. Second, the pursuit must be commenced within the zone where the violation took place and may only continue as long as it is not interrupted. Third, in order to commence a hot pursuit, a visual or auditory signal to stop must be given at a distance which enables the foreign ship to see or hear the warning. Fourth, the right of hot pursuit may only be exercised by warships or other duly marked and identifiable governmental vessels of the coastal State that may also use military aircrafts under certain limited conditions. Fifth, the competent authorities of the coastal State should have good reasons to believe that a violation has taken place. In cases where a ship has been stopped or arrested in circumstances which do not justify the exercise of this right, the coastal State would be obliged to compensate for any loss or damage caused. Last but not least, the pursuit would cease as soon as the ship pursued enters the territorial sea of its own State or of a third State (Tanaka, 2012: 163 ff.)."

A new society-nature relationship was constructed, and it was popularized by means of metaphors and models that illustrated the interdependence and vulnerability of humankind and mother earth and was promoted vigorously in the public debate in all Western European countries (Jansen et.al, 1998: 280; Baker et.al, 1997: 2)."

Hence, there was a need to think about alternative development strategies to ensure that Third World industrialization would not cause deterioration of the environment and further deplete resources. At the same time, as pointed out by Third World leaders, foreign debt, widespread hunger, poverty and endemic disease made it apparent that continued growth was necessary (Bäckstrand et. al, 1996: 212)."

    "explanation": "Second phase of international environmental law starts with the establishment of the UN. In this period, the United Nations Conference on the Conservation and Utilization of Resources. (UNCCUR) laid the foundation of future international environmental action. <br/>Over this period, a range of international organizations with competence in environmental matters were created, and legal instruments were adopted at both the regional and global level, which addressed particular sources of pollution and the conservation of general and particular environmental resources, such as oil pollution, nuclear testing, wetlands, the marine environment and its living resources, the quality of freshwaters, and the dumping of waste at sea."

Soft law arrangements are available in international environmental law. International soft law refers to those norms of international environmental law, which are not binding, but play an important interpretive role in the construction and interpretation of principles and rules of formal international environmental law. Although the concept of soft law as a legal rule is not strictly binding, it has some legal significance. Thus, certain forms of soft law, like guidelines, codes of conduct, programs of action and declarations are not binding but, nevertheless, may gain some effect and over time merge into hard law.

    "explanation": "Precautionary Principle is a controversial principle in international environmental law since it represents an attempt to reverse burden of proof in unknown, potentially risky and unclear endeavors. The historical roots of the precautionary principle traced back to German environmental discourse of the early 1970s. Dying trees signaled severe environmental stress on German forests. At that time, however, no proof was available that acid rain caused this unfortunate state of affairs. The government nevertheless acted firmly and imposed several restrictive measures on fossil power plants out of precaution. This was the birth of the so-called Vorsorgeprinzip - or precautionary principle - one the key constituents of prospective environmental politics in Germany. It was later developed in North Sea Conferences of the 1980s and then became a part of the sustainability discourses (Van der Roest et al, 2003: 6).<br/>According to Atapattu “It was used for the first time in the legal regime governing ozone depletion and was included in the Rio Declaration as an approach. Moreover, it was included as a principle in the UNFCCC, and it has since been included in the Biosafety Protocol. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration embodies the precautionary approach: “to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation” (Atapattu, 2017: 258)."

This desire led to the inclusion of<br/>the temporal limitation clause that enabled States<br/>to put the Convention into the effect for the events<br/>occurred before 1 January 1951. In response to the<br/>wish of certain Governments, the 1951 Convention<br/>also gave to Contracting States the possibility of<br/>limiting their obligations under the Convention<br/>to persons who had become refugees as a result of<br/>events occurring in Europe (Odman, 1995: 41).<br/>Accordingly, the expression “events occurring<br/>before January 1, 1951” primarily constituted a<br/>temporal limitation; besides, a geographical<br/>limitation has been regulated as” events occurring<br/>in Europe” and “events occurring in Europe or<br/>elsewhere”. More importantly, States Parties to the<br/>1951 Convention have been given the authority<br/>to make a declaration specifying which of these<br/>meanings it would apply.<br/>According to these, the phrase given in option E is wrong.
