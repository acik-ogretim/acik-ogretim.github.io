Choice D is about what branch someone is studying at university. Choice E is about the location someone lives. These are not questions about free time. However, choice C ‘What do you do on weekends?’ is about the activities someone does when he/she is usually not working or studying. The correct answer is C.\n<br/>‘A seçeneğindeki sorunun anlamı ‘Tek çocuk musun?,’ B seçeneği ‘En iyi arkadaşın nasıl biri?,’ D seçeneği ‘Turizm bölümü öğrencisi misin?’ ve E seçenği ‘Bu yakınlarda mı yaşıyorsun?’dur. ‘Free time’ (boş zaman) ile ilgili soru ‘What do you do on weekends?’ (Hafta sonları ne yaparsın?) olup doğru yanıt C’dir."

      "E": "I can’t either."
    },
    "explanation": "In the dialogue, Harry cannot go to the cinema because he has no money. Nelly cannot go either because she has an exam the next day. There are several ways to agree with a negative sentence (Harry: I can't ...). One of them is to use the same auxiliary or modal verb with 'not ... either' (I can't either). In choice E, Nelly gives the right answer by saying ‘I can’t either.’ The correct answer is E.\n Diyalogta her iki kişi de yarın sinemaya gidemeyecektir. Harry’nin gerekçesi parası olmamasıdır. Nelly’nin de yarın sınavı vardır. Olumsuz bir cümleye (Harry: I can’t…) katılmak, aynı fikirde/durumda olduğumuzu göstermek için çeşitli yollar vardır. Birisi aynı tense/modal (zaman/kiplik) yardımcı fiillini kullanarak olumsuz cümleler için ‘yardımcı fiil + <strong>not</strong> … <strong>either’</strong> (I can’t either) kullanmaktır. E seçeneğindeki Nelly, tıpkı Harry gibi ‘I can + not either’ derse doğru karşılık vermiş olur. Doğru yanıt E ’dir."

    },
    "explanation": "In the dialogue, Alan uses an affirmative sentence (I am...) to say that he is allergic to chocolate. However, Selda uses a negative sentence (I am not). Therefore, she does not agree with Alan and she does not need to use too/either. Because there is disagreement, she can use expressions of surprise such as 'Really?' instead. The correct answer is A. \n Diyalogda Alan olumlu yapı kullanarak (I am …) çikolataya alerjisi olduğunu söylemektedir. Selda ise ikinci cümlesinde aynı tense’in zıt ve olumsuz haliyle yanıt vermektedir (I am not). Bu durumda Selda, Alan ile aynı fikirde/durumda değildir ve too/either gibi yapılar kullanması gerekmez. Arada görüş/durum farklılığı olduğu için, bu yapılar yerine ‘Really?’ (Gerçekten mi?) gibi bir şaşırma belirten ifade kullanılabilir. Doğru yanıt A’dir."

      "B": "do",
      "C": "make",
      "D": "is",
      "E": "can"
    },
    "explanation": "There is no verb in this sentence. The subject includes two people, so it takes verbs for plural subjects. After the blank, there is the adjective 'late.' Therefore, in the blank a main verb, not an auxiliary, is needed. In this case, a copular verb (<em>be </em>verbs <em>am, is, are, was, were, </em>or <em>appear, seem, look, become, </em><em>get </em>etc.<em>) </em>can be used to link the subject to the adjective. Choice A helps to make a correct sentence by linking Ahmet and Hasan to late: Ahmet and Hasan are late to class today. Choices B, C or E can be correct if they become auxiliary verbs with a new main verb or if they take an object. Therefore, the correct answer is A. \n Bu cümlede fiil eksiktir. Cümledeki özne iki kişiden oluşmaktadır ve bu yüzden çoğul özne fiileri alırlar. Boşluktan sonra ise bir sıfat olan ‘late’ gelmektedir. Bu nedenle boşluğa gelecek olan fiil yardımcı fiil değil, asıl fiil olmalıdır. Bu durumda özne ile sıfat arasında bağlantı kuran ve billdirme/durum belirten ‘copular verb’ (<em>be türevleri olan am, is, are, was, were, veya appear, seem, look, become </em>and <em>get gibi) </em>fiiller gelebilir. Bu koşullarda, seçeneklerdeki ‘are’ ile cümle cümle tamamlandığında ‘Ahmet and Hasan are late to class today.’ (Ahmet ve Hasan bugün derse geç kaldılar.) olur. B, C, E seçeneklerinin doğru olabilmesi için ya seçeneklerin yardımcı fiil olması ve asıl fiil olacak yeni bir fiil eklenmesi, ya da nesne gelmesi gerekir. Doğru yanıt A’dır."

In the second and third blanks possessive pronouns are used because they used instead of the nouns rather than with the nouns they address.
