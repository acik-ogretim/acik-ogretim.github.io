It is important to know that companies cannot make all of their investments with the money they have generated in the past years, or they already have. Third group consists of dividend decisions. Financial managers should decide on how much of their earnings will be paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends, and how much will be retained to finance a company’s future investments and growth. It is a strategic decision involving a trade-off between the payment of dividends to shareholders and retention of earnings to finance investments."

In other words, a derivative is a legal contract that involves two parties, a buyer and a seller who agree to do something for each other. Derivative contracts are recognized by the legal system as commercial contracts and they set the right and obligations of each involved party. For instance, let’s assume that there are two parties, A and B. In the contract, Party A agrees to sell an APPLE stock (AAPL) to party B for $200 after 3 months from now. Here, our underlying asset is AAPL and Party A is obligated to sell this stock to party B after 3 months. The value of this contract is based on the performance of AAPL. If the value of the stock rises from $191to $200, this contract will be valuable for Party B who is buying the underlying asset for $191. If AAPL price increases to $200 and Party A refuses to sell the stock to Party B, Party B can refer to the related authorities (lawyers, judges, and juries) to step in and resolve this issue.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

Forward commitments contracts (such as forward contracts, futures contracts, and swaps) provide a buyer or seller the ability to lock in a price to buy or sell an underlying asset whereas contingent claims (such as option) provide a buyer or a seller the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a price previously fixed. Derivatives are useful instruments in financial markets through which a risk can be transferred from one party to another. Investors use derivatives to hedge risk arising from unexpected changes in the market value of an underlying asset. Moreover, derivatives are helpful in creating trading strategies. Derivatives are more liquid than the underlying asset and less costly in terms of participating in deals and transactions.<br/>Derivatives are high leverage contracts that require a small amount of capital to initiate a derivative related contract.<br/>There are two categories of markets where derivatives are created: Exchange-traded derivatives markets and Over-the-counter derivatives markets (OTC). Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized such that its terms and conditions are precisely specified by the exchange where OTC is the customizable contract that can be customized by the involving parties. In other words, derivatives exchange-trade standardizes every term and condition of contracts except their prices. For example, suppose an exchange introduces a standardized contract for metal Gold. It specifies the quality of gold, the quantity of gold, expiration date, and the location where the gold should be delivered. Normally, the price of a derivative contract is defined by buyers and sellers (long and short parties). Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is an example of exchangetraded derivatives markets in which contracts such as futures and options are traded. CME is responsible for the clearing and settlement process. Clearing is the procedure by which an exchange settles a transaction and registers the buy and sell parties’ identities. The settlement is the procedure by which an exchange transfers money from one party to another. Since futures contracts are standardized contracts, it makes derivatives more liquid in comparison to OTC markets contracts. Moreover, the price process in the exchange-traded derivatives is more transparent in comparison to OTC markets.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements related to derivatives and derivative markets in the options are correct."

The other attribute of clearing houses is that there are daily settlements and any party, which is in the profit as a result of the performance of the underlying asset, the clearinghouse deducts money from the losing party and adds them to the winner party. In the over-the-counter derivatives markets, investors directly trade legal derivative contracts without involving an intermediary. Such markets are also called informal derivative markets because the engaged parties are not obligated to carry out their promises. Though both buyer and seller of OTC contracts informally agree to buy or sell derivative contracts, there is still the possibility of a default. It is worth mentioning that the market makers make a profit through the bid-ask spread as they fulfill the needs of both buyer and seller through buying from a seller at one price and selling to a buyer at a higher price.<br/>The OTC contracts are customized contracts, and they are less liquid than exchange-traded derivative contracts.

The parties establish the identity and quantity of the underlying, the manner in which the contract will be executed or settled when it expires, and the fixed price at which the underlying will be exchanged. This fixed price is called the ``forward price”.<br/>To explain this definition, let us recall our previous example in which we assumed that both parties A and B sign a contract that states Party A will sell an APPLE stock (AAPL) to Party B, and Party B commits to buy the stock after 3 months. This type of contract is called a forward contract. In forward contracts, both involving parties agree to do something for one another after 3 months. Both sides of the forward contract agree on the underlying asset (AAPL) at a later point in time (3 months). They have established the identity of underlying (AAPL) and its quantity (1 stock) at a fixed price regardless of what it will cost at the expiration date. Both parties on the manner in which the contract will be executed or will be settled when it expires (whether to deliver the underlying asset physically or pay in cash). In brief, forward commitments have the following characteristics:<br/><ul> <li>They are customized contracts so to suit both involving parties’ needs i.e. grade, time, and place of delivery.</li> <li>There is no specific location or address to trade forward contracts.</li> <li>Any type of commodities can be traded via forward contracts.</li> </ul> There are three different types of forward commitments: Forward, Futures, and Swaps contracts.

    "explanation": "In comparison to futures contracts, swaps contracts are more prone to default risk in the following aspects: First, a performance bond is not required in swaps contracts, whereas a margin is required in futures contracts, and this tends to give swaps slightly more default risk than futures contracts. Second, the counterparty in swaps contracts are generally a commercial or investment bank, whereas in futures contracts the clearinghouse is considered the counterparty and commercial or investment bank are more prone to default than a clearinghouse. Third, futures contracts are daily marked-to-market and the entire gain or loss is settled from day to day, whereas the settlement in swaps contracts are longer payments is longer i.e. six months. The riskiness of a swaps contracts falls somewhere between the riskiness of futures contracts and the forward contracts."

In 1946, the first big devaluation in the history of Turkey was carried out. This decision caused cost inflation to increase. Imports were increasing rapidly, thus the foreign trade deficit was also rising. There was a temporary recession and contraction in the markets. Industrial projects were adjourned. The Government ruled by Recep Peker resigned and it was replaced by Hasan Saka on 10 September, 1947. The economy was again in a bad condition in 1948. In the general elections held in 1950, the Democrat Party came to power with 53% of the votes. New lands were opened to agriculture. Due to the good climatic conditions, productivity in agriculture also increased export prices. During this period, foreign aid also increased and the 1946 crisis was overcome.
