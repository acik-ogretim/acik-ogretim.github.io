He concluded that early life experiences, which people are mostly unaware of, play an important role in the development of these problems. He proposed a theory of personality development and a method of psychotherapy. He suggested that humans have sexual and aggressive drives, which affect the development of personality. He explained that the expressions of sexual and aggressive drives are punished in childhood and people experience conflict and anxiety. In order to cope with such conflict and anxiety, humans tend to keep their childhood experiences in unconscious mind. Sigmund Freud proposed a free-association technique, which aims to make people with psychological problems aware of their anxious childhood experiences."

Describing refers to identifying how behavior occurs (e.g., authoritarian people like hierarchy in society). <strong>Explaining refers to uncovering the causes of behavior (e.g., authoritarianism develops in people with controlling parents).</strong> Predicting refers to foreseeing the behavior in different conditions (e.g., authoritarian people perceive their mothers controlling). Controlling refers to changing the behavior by changing its causes (e.g., to expose a group of individuals to controlling behaviors and then to measure authoritarianism in them). Improving refers to using psychological explanations to promote humans’ wellbeing (e.g., to develop a program to help mothers in rearing nonauthoritarian children).<br/>Given the information above, <strong>the answer is A, \"explaining the behavior\".</strong>"

The research can be about anything as long as the researcher’s characteristics, the topic to be examined, and the technical conditions are suitable. However; it is preferred that the study be based on a need. While deciding on a subject, the researcher may benefit from his/her own observations, resource person and publications or theoretical knowledge. As an example, let’s take the following as the subject of our research: ‘Problems of workers working at a workplace’. The answer is B."

    "explanation": "Stimulus in the environment has two aspects: <strong>environmental stimulus and attended stimulus.</strong> Let me explain with an example. Imagine that you are walking in a park where there are lots of stimuli that you can potentially perceive such as trees, banks, birds, etc. These are environmental stimuli. When you are walking in the park a distinctive leaf captures your attention. Then, you reliaze that this thing is not a leaf; it is a leaf-shaped bug. Thus, you focus on the bug. The bug becomes the center of your attention. In other words, it becomes the attended stimulus. If you shift your attention (for example, David Beckham comes into the park for running), your attended stimulus also changes (David Beckham).<br/><strong>Absolute threshold</strong> is explained as the energy level at which the lowest level stimulus is noticed or discerned by the human senses, including vision, hearing, taste, smell and touch. For example, the lowest amount of salt in a glass is noticed by stimulating your sensory system.<br/><strong>The difference threshold </strong>refers to is the lowest noticeable change in the intensity of the stimulus. It occurs depending on how great the intensity of the stimulus is. For example, if you lift a five-kilogram and a ten-kilogram dumbbell consecutively, you can notice the difference. However, if you lift 100 kilos and then 105 kilos, the difference is most likely indistinguishable<strong>.</strong><br/><strong>Transduction</strong> is the transformation of one form of energy into another form of energy.<br/>The correct answer is C."

(b) Elements that are within the same region of space appear to be grouped together. This is called principle of common region. (c) The principle of uniform connectedness states that a connected region of visual properties, such as lightness, color, texture, or motion is perceived as a single unit. (c) The principle of synchrony states that visual events that occur at the same time are perceived as belonging together.<br/>The correct option is A."

Modal behaviors, yet, refer to complicated behaviors observed among all the members of a species. Honey production by bees and spiders producing webs are among modal behaviors. Although both behaviors are permanent and goal oriented, they do not represent learning because they are innate. If the change in behavior is not a result of an individual’s interaction with the environment, but instead is a by-product of an illness, fatigue, medication, or accident, then this change cannot be classified as learning. For instance, nonsense talk exhibited by a patient waking up from anesthesia is not learning since stimulus here is medication. If the change in a behavior is dependent on growing, then it is not learning. For example, clumsiness displayed by a teenager during adolescence cannot be considered learning since it is a result of growing body parts. The answer is E."

Temporal contiguity is the main requirement for such an association to surface. When temporal contiguity between two stimuli disappears for a long time, the association also weakens or fades away; in other words, extinction is observed. In Pavlov’s experiment, the dog stops salivating upon the sound of the bell when meat is not delivered after that sound for repeated times (when temporal contiguity is dissolved). The answer is D."

Learning occurs with an “Ah-ha feeling” that emerges in one’s mind like a lightbulb suddenly turning on. Upon encountering similar problems, the organism can employ the same mechanism to overcome that problem because an insight has been formed to either solve that particular type of problem or to learn.

Bandura stated that people learn through observation. Also known as taking someone as a model or imitation, learning through observation states that people outline a mental representation of a behavior they observe and assimilate that behavior into their own repertoire.

Both low and high levels of anxiety negatively influence learning, and the optimal anxiety level is best for learning"

The existence of a pleasant stimulus in the learning environment raises the odds for the recurrence of the same behavior in the future. In negative reinforcement, the withdrawal of an aversive stimulus from the learning environment amplifies the possibility of recurrence for a desired behavior in the future. In both types of reinforcement, the only constant is the boost in the frequency of a desired behavior"

    "explanation": "<strong>Adolescence</strong> is the period from 10-12 years to 18-21 years of age and starts with the signs of puberty. In this period dramatic changes in hormones and physiology take place. These changes include voice, growth of facial and pubic hair and breasts. Psychological development also consists of visible changes such as, becoming more independent from parents and spending lots of time with friends. This period is valid also for identity development."

It is concerned with whether human development is affected by nature (genetic makeup) or nurture (environment), and with the extent to which aspects of development are affected by nature and by nurture. According to the nature part of the debate, humans’ genetic background determines a kind of biological program for each human being. This is unique to a person and influence a person’s individual tendency and growth potential for a certain aspect of development15. In contrast with the nature part, the nurture part of the debate emphasizes the importance of environmental experiences and influences on human development. From this perspective, human beings are born with a tabula rasa (a blank state) and gain developmental aspects through exposure to the environment across the years."

Expertise occurs usually in middle adulthood rather than early adulthood since being an expert on something needs lots of time, lots of practice and experience, and effort."

Respondent behavior is involuntary and doesn’t need to be learned. Conversely, <strong>operant behavior </strong>is a learned response that occurs voluntarily. It is shaped by the reinforcements following the behavior. According to Skinner, operant behavior is more important than the respondent behavior, because it can change the environment as well. For instance, the baby smiles (operant behavior) and in turn her mother attends at her (reinforcement). The mother’s attention increases the chance that the baby will smile again, and that’s why it is considered as a reinforcement.</li> </ol>"

    },
    "explanation": "Karen Horney was a German-born American psychoanalyst. She basically opposed the assumption that personality is shaped through the roles of aggressive and sexual impulses. Rather, she highlighted the effect of interpersonal relations and social factors on the development of personality. Horney basically claimed that the basic anxiety in childhood, characterized by feeling insecure and helpless, is more fundamental in personality development. The child learns to deal with this anxiety in three ways: approaching other people, moving against other people (aggression), or avoiding them."

    "explanation": "Harry Stack Sullivan was an American psychologist. His views diverged from that of Freud’s especially in the sense that Sullivan gave a special emphasis on the role of interpersonal relations (especially the relations with significant others) in shaping one’s personality. Moreover, he suggested the term personafication: one’s mental representations of herself/himself and other people. You might think that personafication sounds more cognitive than psychoanalytic, and this is another important difference between Sullivan’s view of personality and classical psychoanalytic theory. He placed more emphasis on the conscious processes but did not completely ignore the unconscious. Sullivan proposed that there are three ways that we see ourselves: the good-me, the bad-me, and the not-me. The good-me is what we like about ourselves and what we want to show to others. Conversely, the bad-me includes what we do not like about ourselves and try to hide from others. Most of the time we are consciously aware of the good-me and the bad-me, and the anxiety that is provoked because of the bad-me. What we are not consciously aware of ourselves is the not-me; the things that we do not accept as part of ourselves. The not-me provokes so much anxiety that it is kept in the unconscious."

    },
    "explanation": "Rationalization generally occurs when the ego experiences a feeling of guilt, due to an unacceptable drive, feeling or because of a faulty behavior and it is difficult for the person to accept the responsibility at the conscious level. For instance, a person who is rejected by someone might be unconsciously blaming her/himself. So, the ego might rationalize this situation, saying that “s/he is not attractive at all”. In another example, a thief might rationalize her/his behavior saying that “everybody is stealing, why shouldn’t I?”. It should be noted that rationalization, as a defense mechanism, does not mean “to be more reasonable” or “to have a different perspective”. First, higher- order thinking processes such as reasoning operate at the conscious level and do not intervene with unconscious processes. Secondly, rationalization functions as a strategy for guilt-reduction and avoidance from responsibility. The answer is D."

    },
    "explanation": "Latency Stage is assumed to begin at 6 and lasts until the age of 12, before puberty begins. This stage is not characterized by a specific erogenous zone, because sexual impulses are repressed into the unconscious. This becomes more reasonable when you consider that the biggest conflict in the phallic stage is resolved through repression. Therefore, in the latency stage children seem to be uninterested in sexuality, their own bodies or other people’s bodies. Their attention is directed towards other things that are socially acceptable, such as studying, same- sex friendships and displaying gender-normative behaviors. It is highly common that at these ages both genders avoid and occasionally express disgust towards the opposite-sex and towards sexual relationships. The answer is B."
