Price discrimination aims to capture a greater surplus than what can be achieved under uniform pricing.<br/>Classification of the types of price discrimination was first proposed by Pigou (1920). In first-degree or perfect price discrimination, a firm has perfect information about each consumer’s willingness to pay. In second-degree price discrimination, a firm cannot identify the consumers to discriminate on prices. However, the firm knows that there are different groups of consumers and can use selfselection mechanisms to induce consumers to rank themselves in a way that generates additional profit. Third-degree price discrimination, also known as market segmentation, occurs when a firm acknowledges variations in the willingness to pay among different consumer groups and knows which consumer belongs to which group. In recent times, these pricing strategies have been alternatively labeled as personalized pricing, menu pricing, and group pricing, respectively."

      "D": "The market should be indivisible",
      "E": "Sellers should have no control over pricing policies"
    },
    "explanation": "Conditions of Price Discrimination<br/>Price discrimination can be applied under the following certain conditions: • Sellers should have market power: Price discrimination aims to raise profits by charging various prices to different buyers or different prices for different units purchased by the same buyer. In order to charge different prices to different individuals or businesses or different prices for different quantities of the same buyer, the seller must have market power, or the group of sellers must have an explicit or implicit agreement on price policies. When a firm discriminates prices, at least one price will be higher than the marginal cost, and only a firm with market power can do that. • The market should be divisible: The seller should be able to identify different groups of consumers. Examples of market segmentation are domestic and foreign markets, medical treatment for the rich and poor, and electricity supplied to homes and businesses. • Different markets should have different price elasticities of demand: The target of price discrimination is to increase total revenue by setting a relatively higher (lower) price in the market where demand is relatively inelastic around the current price in the market. Thus, if the price elasticity of demand in various markets is the same, there will be no scope for price discrimination. • No resale (no arbitrage) principle: If a firm sets different prices, consumers who buy at a lower price should not be able to resell the product to other consumers who pay a higher price. Otherwise, there will be no incentive for the firm to discriminate prices because nobody will buy the product at a higher price. Similarly, if a firm applies a quantity discount for its product, the discount should be such that it does not encourage high-volume purchasers to resell it to other consumers."

    "explanation": "Third-Degree Price Discrimination (Group Pricing)<br/>Three key features characterize third-degree price discrimination or group pricing. First, consumers have characteristics that are observable by the firm, such as age, income, geographical location, or educational attainment. A firm with market power can group consumers according to these characteristics in terms of their willingness to pay for its product. Second, the same firm can prevent arbitrage between different groups. Finally, a key feature of third-degree price discrimination is that all consumers in a given group are offered the same price, which differs between groups. Within each group, consumers make individual decisions regarding the quantity they wish to purchase at the given price. In the real world, for example, young people are likely to respond flexibly to air travel discounts, but businesspeople do not. This brings us to the third degree of price discrimination or market segmentation."

    },
    "explanation": "Second-Degree Price Discrimination (Non-Linear Pricing)<br/>Any attempt to implement differentiated two-part tariff and block pricing policies will not work in this case. Therefore, the firm has to use second-degree price discrimination (menu pricing).<br/>In the case of menu pricing, the firm will sell two packages: a small package for low-demand consumers and a large package for high-demand consumers. The small package includes 5.5 units and is sold for $143, which is equal to the area under the demand function. High-demand consumers can buy either the small or the large package.<br/>If a high-demand consumer buys a small package, she will pay $143, and her consumer surplus will be $121 (see Figure ). Therefore, a high-demand can buy the large package only if her consumer surplus is at least $121. The firm will offer the large package at $202 to allow highdemand consumers to realize a surplus of $121 when they buy this package, which is enough to make<br/>them opt out of the small package (5.5 units for $143) package.<br/>The firm will earn $168 profit from a high-demand consumer ($202 - (4 × 8.5) = $168) and $121 from a low-demand consumer ($143 - (4 × 5.5) = $121). Of course, low-demand customers will not buy the large package because their maximum willingness to pay for 8.5 products is only $144.<br/>The firm designed the two menu options to solve identification and arbitrage problems by enabling consumers to reveal who they are through their purchases. The firm now offers a menu of 5.5 products for $143 and another menu of 8.5 products for $202. Menu pricing has a very important feature. The average price per product of the small package ($143 for 5.5 products) is $26, but the average price of the large package is $23.76 ($202 / 8.5). Therefore, the second package offers a volume discount compared to the first one"

We will first analyze the difference between credible and non-credible threats because we assume that firms are rational actors, and they know that their competitors are also rational. A rational firm cares only about its own profit, and if a threat against a competitor reduces its profit, it will not be a credible threat.

Similar to those in the EU, the substantive provisions of Turkish competition law are set on three pillars: (a) “Agreements, Concerted practices and Decisions Limiting Competition” (Article 4), (b) “Abuse of Dominant Position” (Article 6), and (c) “Mergers or Acquisitions” (Article 7).<br/>Law No. 4054 in Türkiye is based on three pillars similar to the EU: agreements limiting competition, abuse of dominant position, and mergers or acquisitions."

    "text": "What is the primary purpose of defining the \"relevant market\" in competition law?",
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "options": {
      "A": "To set a fixed geographical boundary for where a product is sold and bought.",
      "B": "To determine the monopolistic practices of a single dominant firm in the market.",
      "C": "To outline the set of products and areas which exercise competitive constraint or pressure on each other.",
      "D": "To implement the Hypothetical Monopolist Test (HMT) only in merger cases.",
      "E": "To simplify the process of identifying barriers to entry and expansion in the market."
    },
    "explanation": "In competition law, the concept of “relevant market” has a different meaning than the place where a certain product is sold and bought. The relevant market comprises the set of products and areas which exercise competitive constraint or pressure on each other. For example, in a merger or competition law case about the suppliers of “apple” affecting a certain geographic area,” the “relevant market” can be defined wider than “apple” and include other types of fresh fruits if it is understood that other fruits exercise competitive pressure against apple in this area and are substitutable enough to apple in the eyes of consumers.<br/>To outline the set of products and areas which exercise competitive constraint or pressure on each other."

    "text": "Why might the assessment of dominance in competition law consider more than just the market share of a firm?",
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "options": {
      "A": "Because market share alone is sufficient to determine the market power of a firm.",
      "B": "Because only firms with a market share of less than 40% can be considered dominant.",
      "C": "Because other market characteristics and factors such as barriers to entry and buyers' bargaining power also influence a firm's market power.",
      "D": "Because the concentration level of competitors is irrelevant in assessing dominance.",
      "E": "Because market share thresholds are universally fixed across all jurisdictions."
    },
    "explanation": "Market share is not the sole measure of a dominant position. Other characteristics of the market, such as the likelihood of entry and buyers’ bargaining power, are also taken into account in assessing the market power of a firm. In this respect, competition authorities assess whether there are barriers to entry or expansion in the market. Barriers to entry or expansion may originate from the characteristics of the relevant market or the characteristics or behavior of the undertaking examined. The likelihood of entry into the market by new undertakings or of expansion of undertakings operating in the market can exert competitive pressure on the behavior of the undertaking under investigation. In assessing whether expansion or entry is likely, competition authorities investigate whether it is sufficiently profitable for the relevant undertaking. Possible reactions of the undertaking examined and other competitors in the market can create risks for the success of the entry or expansion.<br/>Because other market characteristics and factors such as barriers to entry and buyers' bargaining power also influence a firm's market power."

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "options": {
      "A": "Agreements and concerted practices that facilitate or likely facilitate the prevention, distortion, or restriction of competition in a market.",
      "B": "Any agreement or practice that promotes competition in a particular market for goods or services.",

      "D": "Exclusive dealings that encourage economic welfare by allowing firms to improve efficiency.",
      "E": "Practices that increase supply amounts and encourage competitive bidding in tenders."
    },
    "explanation": "Since in some cases it may not be possible to prove the existence of an explicit agreement in practice, the act also prohibits “concerted practices,” which can be defined as the direct or indirect relations between undertakings that replace their own independent activities and ensure a coordination and practical cooperation provided that they lead to the same result as an agreement. Firms behaving in a concerted manner benefit from some factors facilitating collusion. For example, they can use direct or indirect means for communicating to reach a consensus about the strategies they will adopt. On the other hand, determining what kind of facilitating factor constitutes a sufficient piece of evidence for proving concerted practice is a legal matter, and is not always easy to distinguish whether a certain type of facilitating factor has the object or effect of restricting competition.<br/>Agreements and concerted practices that facilitate or likely facilitate the prevention, distortion, or restriction of competition in a market."

    "options": {
      "A": "Vertical agreements are automatically exempt from block exemption if the parties have a market share greater than 30%.",
      "B": "Vertical restraints are unregulated in Turkish competition law, allowing for unrestricted manufacturer control over retail pricing.",
      "C": "Manufacturers are prohibited from setting maximum resale prices or suggesting resale prices to retailers.",

      "E": "The Turkish Competition Authority encourages vertical agreements that include non-compete obligations indefinitely or for periods extending beyond five years."
    },
    "explanation": "In many markets, the goods and services bought by customers or consumers are distributed or sold by distributors and retailers instead of their producers. The agreements signed between undertakings operating at different levels of the production or distribution chain to purchase, sell, or resale particular goods or services are called “vertical agreements.” The main restraints seen in vertical agreements can be exemplified as follows: Sellers might assign an exclusive area to their distributors and prohibit them from selling outside this area (exclusive territory), sellers might determine the resale price of retailers (RPM), sellers might oblige buyers to purchase a certain minimum amount of goods from them and not to purchase the goods of seller’s competitors (exclusive dealing), sellers might require buyers to pay a fixed franchise fee.<br/>Vertical agreements involving restrictions on sales regions or customers of distributors or retailers generally cannot benefit from block exemption."
