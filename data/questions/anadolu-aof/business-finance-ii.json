Secondly, the stockholders who hold residual claims in sharing the earnings and assets of the company demand a higher yield. Since creditors have a priority in their claims, higher debt ratios and the rising probability of bankruptcy heighten the risk borne by the stockholders.

Furthermore, the tax rates directly impel the level of investments and financing mechanisms. Risk escalates in an economic environment with high inflation and interest rates. Thus both debt and equity become more expensive and scarce. In such an environment businesses are hesitant in making new investments.

Therefore, both the cost of debt and equity remain constant no matter how heavily debt capital is induced to the capital structure of the firm. Consequently, in an environment where there are no taxes, the higher the financial leverage, the lower the WACC, thus the higher the firm value. The net income approach ignores the rising bankruptcy risk at higher leverage.

    "explanation": "As a broad definition, we can say that the debt and equity mix is called the capital structure of a firm. Because the capital structure determines the value of the firm, a target capital structure is tried to be maintained for shareholders’ wealth maximization, nevertheless, the actual portions of debt and equity financing alter over time. Assessing the target capital structure requires <em>an appraisal of the financing sources, the evaluation of their risk, the examination of the maturity-cost relation of debt and the estimation of the cost of equity for different capital budget amounts</em>. The correct answer is D."

    "explanation": "Bankruptcy risk negatively affects the value of a firm. Firstly, the before-tax cost of debt increases which makes debt financing more costly. Secondly, the stockholders who hold residual claims in sharing the earnings and assets of the company demand a higher yield. Since creditors have a priority in their claims, higher debt ratios and the rising probability of bankruptcy heighten the risk borne by the stockholders. As a result, the cost of the funds raised by the company, no matter debt or equity upsurge, raises the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The value of the firm declines as the bankruptcy risk rises since the free cash flows (FCF) drop with the loss of confidence in the firm. Another problem that is caused by the rising bankruptcy risk is the underinvestment in positive NPV projects. The correct answer is A."

Capital budgeting includes long-term decisions about non-current assets of a company. Decisions about these assets need extra attention from managers because they are more expensive than the current assets, and unlike current assets, it is difficult to unwind once proceeded difficult to resell in the market quickly. The outcome of capital budgeting is either approval or rejection of the investment project. In order to come to that point, a financial manager needs analytical tools to make analysis and come to a conclusion according to the results of the analysis together with his/her intuition about the project. There are a number of simple and sophisticated analytical tools that managers use for project analysis. However, main consideration, of course, is “return and risk” and “benefit and cost” of each project proposal.

These two may change the value of the firm. At the same time, the cost of capital is used as a kind of measure or reference point to make an investment decision. Expected rate of return from a capital investment project should at least be equal to the cost of capital. If the cost of capital used in the evaluation is calculated wrong, then a financial manager may approve projects that should be rejected (overinvest), or may reject projects that should be approved (underinvest).

    "explanation": "Corporate Strategy and Capital Budgeting<br/>Capital budgeting decisions are part of a company’s objectives, goals, and strategies, rather than being stand-alone ideas of managers. Engineering department, marketing department, or any other department proposes an investment project to senior managers. Then, managers allocate company’s funds to projects that they believe will create a positive value. These investment projects are ideas which stem from and which are in line with the company’s main objectives, goals and strategies. Let’s remember the concept of strategy. “A strategy is the formulation and implementation of a company’s key decisions” (Baker and English, 2011). Corporate strategy includes both strategies for company’s whole portfolio of resources and strategies for only business unit’s products (Baker and English, 2011). For capital budgeting matters, the aim of corporate strategy is to find investment projects which provide positive net present value for the company. In perfectly competitive markets it is assumed that it is not possible to find such a project. This assumption makes calculations of project valuation easy to make. At the same time, this assumption shows the importance of competition for capital budgeting decisions. The higher the competition levels in the market, the more difficult the profitable investment projects to find. There are two main explanations to this. First, entry barriers are higher in more competitive markets. Second, arbitrage possibilities are less in more competitive markets. However, the market for capital investments is not perfectly competitive (market imperfection). It means that it is possible to find projects which add value to a company’s competitive advantage that is why they create shareholder value. Competitive advantage, “a firm’s attribute that may allow the firm to generate economic profits” is key here (Baker and English, 2011). Here, economic profit refers to the risk-adjusted present value of revenue minus all costs, including the opportunity cost of capital. Together with market imperfection, cost-saving projects that will create competitive advantage can be a source for positive economic profit. After valuations on the paper, investment projects are approved or rejected, but before starting to make any valuation, financial managers look at the structure of the market and see if the project contributes to the differentiation of the company from others and gaining competitive advantage. If the answer is yes, then they start choosing the technique, estimating the discount rate, estimating cash flows, and estimating initial cost.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements above related to corporate strategy and capital budgeting are correct.<br/><ul> <li>Strategy refers to formulation and implementation of a company’s key decisions.</li> <li>Corporate strategy refers to strategies for company’s whole portfolio of resources, and strategies for business unit’s products, as well.</li> <li>Competitive advantage refers to a firm’s attribute that may allow the firm to generate economic profits.</li> <li>Economic profit refers to the risk-adjusted present value of revenue minus all costs, including the opportunity cost of capital.</li> </ul> In perfectly competitive markets it is assumed that it is not possible to find investment projects which provide positive net present value.<br/>Positive economic profits (or positive net present value projects) can stem from two sources: i) market imperfections, ii) creating competitive advantage."

Opportunity cost is defined as the return on the best alternative use of an asset; the highest return that will not be earned if funds are invested in a particular project. Opportunity cost should be included in the analysis as it is an incremental cash flow. Externalities are defined as the way in which accepting a project affects the cash flows in other areas of the firm. Externalities should not be included in the analysis as they are not an incremental cash flow. Shipping and installation costs should be included in the analysis as it is an incremental cash flow because they generally require cash payments. Lastly, effects of inflation on cash flows should be included in the analysis as it may be considered as an incremental cash flow because it changes the real value of a cash flow."

    "explanation": "There are two very important items that are related to the estimation of investment projects’ cash flows: financing costs and depreciation.<br/><ol> <li>Financing costs are irrelevant cash flows to capital investment project evaluation which should not be included in the analysis. Although interest and loan payments require cash outflow, one should exclude them while making estimations of cash flows. The reason is cost of financing or minimum rate of required return is included in the capital budgeting analysis in the discount rate. Financing costs are incorporated in the process with the discount rate. Therefore, it would be double-considering if we included financing costs as cash outflows.</li> <li>Depreciation is considered as a relevant cash flow to capital investment project evaluation which should be included in the analysis. In fact, depreciation is a non-cash expense item, but it affects the taxable income of a company. It means that although one does not need any cash to pay depreciation expense each year, it changes the amount of taxes paid which is a cash expense. Remember the income statement and note that depreciation expense is subtracted from revenue, and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) is found. It means that it is deducted before the tax expense is calculated. By this way, depreciation creates a tax-shield. Likewise, in capital investment project’s income statement, depreciation is deducted before the tax expense is calculated. To calculate the cash flow of a project, we should add depreciation amount back to the project’s net income.</li> </ol> Financing costs are incorporated in the capital budgeting analysis with the determination of discount rate, rather than with the estimation of cash flows.<br/>A project’s cash flow = Net income of project + Depreciation<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

    "explanation": "Payback period tells the length of time it takes to get initial cash outflow back, that is the period from the initial cash outflow to the time when the investment project’s cash inflows add up to the initial cash outflow. This technique is a simple, easy to use and easy to understand technique. It is commonly used among managers because it quickly tells when a project pays the initial cash outflow back. It is also easy to explain to managers who are not experts in finance. All you have to do is find when cumulative cash inflows will be equal to initial cash outflow. The assumption is that cash flow occurs at a constant rate throughout the year. It means that you can use a fraction of year while equaling cumulative total amount of cash inflows and the initial cash outflow. This technique also assumes that all investment projects have the same level of risk. Actually, it does not account for the risk of the project at all. Risk is not inherited in the calculation of payback period. Moreover, this technique does not account for the time value of money.<br/>Payback period technique tells the length of time it takes to get the initial cash outflow back.<br/>The decision rule for the payback period technique is simple. Only a project with a payback period shorter than (or equal to) the management’s specified payback period can be approved. And, a project with shorter payback period is better than a project with longer payback period. Besides its easiness, payback period technique has important drawbacks. It does not account for the cash flows after the payback period. However, a project may be very valuable to a company, but since it provides a big cash inflow after the cutoff point in time, a manager would miss it. Besides this drawback, payback period technique is criticized because it does not account for the time value of money and for the risk differences among projects. In order to consider the time value of money, discounted payback period technique is developed.<br/>If a project is independent, approve the project(s) that pays the initial investment back less than a specified payback period.<br/>If a project is mutually exclusive, choose the project that provides the shortest payback period.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

If the NPV is greater than zero (positive NPV) for a project, it means that the project will increase the shareholder value by that amount. If the NPV is smaller than zero (negative NPV) for a project, it means that the project will decrease the shareholder value by that amount. There are three steps of calculating NPV:<br/>1. Estimating cash flows<br/>2. Discounting cash flows by an appropriate discount rate<br/>3. Adding up the discounted cash flows to obtain NPV<br/>In order to find the present value of cash flows, discounting is used. So, we can say that net present value technique accounts for the time value of money. On the other hand, this technique assumes that all investment projects have the same level of risk. Note that it accounts for the risk which is inherited in the discount rate. However, it does not account for the risk differences of different projects. Nevertheless, risk differences may be considered in the technique by using different discount rates for projects with different levels of risk. One should use a higher discount rate for finding the NPV of riskier projects and reflect the extra amount of return demanded by investors in order to compensate for the risk. That is because the riskier the project, the higher the expected rate of return. Decision rule for net present value technique is quite straightforward. For independent projects, approve projects with positive NPV . Reject projects with negative NPV For mutually exclusive projects, choose the project with the biggest NPV. “A positive NPV means the project’s cash inflows are sufficient to repay the initial upfront (time zero) costs as well as the financing cost (at discount rate) over the project’s life. Since NPV is greater than zero, project’s return is greater than the cost of capital (the discount rate)… Projects with negative net present values are not acceptable to a firm. They provide returns lower than the cost of capital and would cause the value of the firm to fall” (Melicher, Nortan, 2011: 486-487).<br/>Net present value technique finds the sum of present value of all cash inflaws and cash otflows of a project over its life.<br/>If a project is independent, approve the project(s) that provide a positive net present value.<br/>If a project is mutually exclusive, choose the project that provides the biggest net present value.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

    "explanation": "Until this point, capital budgeting evaluation techniques_ “Payback period”, “Discounted payback period”, “Net present value”, “Internal rate of return”, “Modified internal rate of return”, “Profitability index”_have assumed that all investment project alternatives of a firm have the same level of risk. There are three kinds of risk sources when we talk about the risk of an investment project. The first one is stand-alone risks that a project exhibits when evaluated alone rather than as part of a combination or portfolio of assets. The second one is within-firm risks that a project has on the total overall riskiness of the company. The third one is market risks that a project has and assessed from the standpoint of a stockholder who has a portfolio of assets (Besley and Brigham, 2012: 522). A simple approach to incorporate risk differences among alternative investment projects to evaluation process is making adjustments to either cash flows or the discount rate according to the risk of the projects. After adjustments, net present value is calculated. This way, net present values includes the information about riskiness of the project, and also risk differences between projects.<br/>One can account for risk differences among alternative investment projects by making adjustments to either cash flows or the discount rate.<br/>Estimating project cash flows is a task which already includes these kinds of adjustments only to a certain degree. Nevertheless, a special attention to incorporate risk into project evaluation is needed. Certainty-equivalent coefficient, which has values between 0 and 1, is used in order to reflect the risk of a project to evaluation. With an increase of the riskiness of the future cash inflow, certaintyequavalent coefficient approaches to 0, and with a decrease of the riskiness of the future cash inflow, certainty-equivalent coefficient approaches to 1. In finding net present value of a project, present value of each year’s expected cash inflow is simply multiplied by the specified certainty-equivalent coefficient that is associated with that cash inflow which is called adjusted cash flow. Note that one should use risk-free interest rate as a discount rate while calculating net present value with adjusted cash flows, because the risk of a project is already included in cash flow adjustment.<br/>Certainty-equivalent coefficient refers to a number between 0 and 1 which is used in order to reflect the risk of a project to evaluation.<br/>In adjusted cash flow approach, one should use risk-free interest rate as a discount rate while calculating net present value because risk of a project is already included in cash flow adjustment.<br/>Establishing discount rate for a project is another task that also includes these kinds of adjustments. Remember that financing of an investment project is the starting point for establishing a discount rate The discount rate should be at least as much as a weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This is the cost of a project’s financing rather than the whole company’s financing. If a project’s risk is substantially above the firm’s general risk, discount rate will be above the WACC. If a project’s risk is substantially below the firm’s general risk, discount rate will be below the WACC. When we think of Net Present Value, we can remember that conceptions about the risk of projects are reflected in the discount rate. The discount rate can be adjusted in a way that it represents the risk differences. That is, when the risk of a project increases, we should increase the discount rate accordingly which is called adjusted discount rate. How much to increase the discount rate is quite subjective and judgmental. Actually, it depends on whether the financial manager who evaluates the project is risk seeking, risk-neutral, or risk-averse. For a given capital investment project, it would be appropriate to expect that a manager who is risk-averse adds a greater risk premium to discount rate than a manager who is risk-seeking. <br/>If a project’s risk is substantially above the firm’s general risk, discount rate will be above the WACC.<br/>If a project’s risk is substantially below the firm’s general risk, discount rate will be below the WACC.<br/>For a given capital investment project, it would be appropriate to expect that a manager who is risk-averse adds a greater risk premium to discount rate than a manager who is risk-seeking.<br/>Most of the time, because of the nature of risk, making adjustments to cash flows or discount rates is not enough for financial managers. They want to know the sources and possible effects of certain risks of a project. They want to measure a project’s risks coming from various sources rather than in general manner. Further analysis is needed to do that. Sensitivity analysis, scenario and simulation analysis, and decision trees are used for this purpose.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements above related to incorporating risk in capital budgeting are correct."

Moreover, managers can price those strategic quantitative factors by using option-pricing methods, and include this price to the net present value of projects. What can be considered as an option? Shapiro (2005:94) has an answer for this question. “Any investment that requires an additional infusion of funds for its completion and offers an uncertain payoff can be viewed as an option”.<br/>Real options refer to the options of managers about capital investment projects which can be priced by using stock option-pricing methodologies.<br/>Exhibit: Typical Options Embedded in Capital Investment Projects (Megginson et al., 2010:340)<br/><ul> <li>Expansion options are options to expand earlier successful investments of a company.

Company obtains an opportunity to choose between to make or not to make additional investments.</li> <li>Abandonment options are options to withdraw resources from a project that fails to live up to shortrun expectations. These withdrawals might be the entire commitment to a project. With an abandonment option, company obtains an opportunity to withdraw part or all of its commitment to a project.</li> <li>Flexibility options are options to have some flexibility about the course of a project such as input flexibility, operating flexibility, and capacity flexibility. Company obtains an opportunity to favor value added by the flexibility.</li> </ul> Real options are valued, or priced in other words, the same as stock options. However, we do not go deep into option pricing methodologies in this section of the book. You can do further reading by searching Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. We just shall remember that real options are priced in a similar way like stock options which is called real option valuation (ROV). Peterson and Fabozzi (2002: 153) list five factors that are important in the valuation of a stock option. Then, they list the real option correspondent of each factor as follows. 1. Effect of stock’s price in stock options is the effect of the present value of cash flows from the investment opportunity in real options. 2. Effect of the exercise (strike) price of the option in stock options is the effect of the present value of the delayed capital expenditure of future cost savings in real options. 3. Effect of the risk-free interest rate in stock options is the same risk-free interest rate in real options. 4. Effect of the volatility of stock’s price in stock options is uncertainty of the project’s cash flows in real options.<br/><ol start=\"5\"> <li>Effect of the time remaining to the expiration of the option in stock options is the effect of the project’s useful life in real options.</li> </ol> “Consider the value of a patent on an untested cure for cancer. The price of obtaining the patent is the option price; the cost of developing, producing, and marketing the drug is the strike price; and the market value of profits on sales of the drug is equivalent to the stock price. The extra funds required to start production will be invested only if this cost is less than the payoff in the form of subsequent profits from the sale of the drug” (Shapiro, 2005:94).<br/>After considering real options associated with a capital investment project, the value of the option will be calculated with an option pricing methodology, and then, value of the option is added up to the traditional net present value (NPV) of the project. After that, decision rule of NPV will be applied in the same way. If projects are independent, positive net present value projects will be approved, but negative net present value projects will be rejected. If projects are mutually exclusive, the project providing the biggest NPV will be prefered."

The company then buys shares from the lowest priced offers. If there are not enough shares offered at the lowest price to accomplish the desired buy-back, the issuer may accept offers from the next higher priced.<br/>4. Targeted Repurchase.

    "explanation": "Tax Preference Theory: Capital Gains are preferred The difference in the tax treatment of dividends versus capital gains influences investor’s preferences. While dividends are taxed at a higher rate than capital gains before 2003, the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003 equalized the tax rates on dividends and capital gains. However, there is still a tax advantage for capital gains returns relative to dividend income. While capital gains taxes are deferred until the stock is actually sold, taxes on dividend income is immediately paid when the dividends are received. Although dividends and capital gains are taxed nearly equally, the present value of taxes paid in the future has a lower effective cost than the value paid today. Also, if investors do not prefer to sell their stocks, they will not incur any obligation to pay taxes.<br/>The correct answer is A."

There exist certain daily buy-back limits on the number of shares in open market share repurchases. For instance, the SEC Rule 10b-18, introduced in 1983, dictates that the company cannot repurchase more than 25 % of the average daily trading volume in the US. 2. Tender Offer. The company can repurchase a number of shares through a tender offer in which it offers to buy shares at a specified price. 3. Dutch auction. The company specifies a price range that it is willing to pay, and shareholders offer how many shares they are willing to sell at that specific price range. The company then buys shares from the lowest priced offers. If there are not enough shares offered at the lowest price to accomplish the desired buy-back, the issuer may accept offers from the next higher priced. 4. Targeted Repurchase. The company can repurchase a block of shares at a negotiated price from major shareholders. The most important example is greenmail transactions, in which the shares are repurchased at a large premium over the current market price"

Because managements are reluctant to increase the dividends unless management is confident in the future. Also, they are reluctant to decrease the dividend because of the negative signal.<br/>2. When a company has more equity than its target capital structure, the company can directly change its capital structure by repurchasing. For instance, a company may issue debt and use the proceeds to repurchase stocks for adjusting its capital structure.<br/>3. A company can repurchase stock to minimize the “dilution effect” associated with exercising the stock options that have been given to employees as bonuses.<br/>4. Due to the signaling effects, stock repurchase is perceived as a positive signal that the company’s stock is undervalued in the financial markets; therefore when a company engages in the stock repurchase, investors prefer to purchase additional shares.<br/>5.

Each risk factor is assumed to be drawn from some known theoretical distribution. The statistical distributions of these individual risk factors are combined to yield a single theoretical distribution for the returns of the entire portfolio. This distribution is then used to calculate the VaR of the portfolio. The VCV method is also known as an analytic or parametric method. It is considered the simplest of the suggested methodologies and thus is often used by banks and other financial institutions, for example, for calculating intra-day VaR figures. The VCV approach is generally used with a normal distribution, which significantly facilitates its calculation. Of course, other distributions can be used, but at a higher computational cost.

    "explanation": "Broadly speaking, credit risk is the risk that a borrower fails to meet obligations for a loan granted. This risk is of vital importance to banks, as their main business involves lending money to be repaid over a certain period, which in some cases, e.g. mortgages, may be 10 to 20 years or more. The quantification and management of credit risk are radically different from market risk, which focuses mainly on changes in asset prices, and which offers an infinite set of probabilities due to available data.

    "explanation": "The Variance-covariance (VCV hereafter) method estimates VaR by first assuming that a portfolio comprises a small number of risk factors (equities, commodities, etc.). Each risk factor is assumed to be drawn from some known theoretical distribution. The statistical distributions of these individual risk factors are combined to yield a single theoretical distribution for the returns of the entire portfolio. This distribution is then used to calculate the VaR of the portfolio. The VCV method is also known as an analytic or parametric method. It is considered the simplest of the suggested methodologies and thus is often used by banks and other financial institutions, for example, for calculating intra-day VaR figures. The VCV approach is generally used with a normal distribution, which significantly facilitates its calculation. Of course, other distributions can be used, but at a higher computational cost.
