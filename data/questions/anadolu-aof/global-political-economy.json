After the invention of the big cannons, and the Ottoman’s dominating the Silk and Spice trade routes, the Western actors, who are looking for new quests, made geographical discoveries as a result of these searches. Western states, which obtained precious metals in the new regions reached with these discoveries, claimed that the real wealth was these mines and led to the emergence of mercantilist thinking, which is the understanding that will dominate global trade for three centuries (Elçin, 2012: 7). The first wave of globalization that began in the 1490s was experienced by the influence of mercantilism and resulted in colonialism."

For example, in the realist approach, states have kept themselves within their borders with the desire to preserve the territorial integrity and to survive. However, in the following process, states understood that they could not remain within these limits and they had to adapt to the new order with the effect of globalization and communication revolution which dominated the system. The new dominant force of the international system has been liberalism. The financial liberalization, capital flows, invisible hand and open market, which have been experienced in this process in which the individual comes to the fore, have had a positive effect on the system for a while. However, this softening and liberalization wind in the global system has evolved into a process where the rich becomes richer and the poor becomes poorer. In this process Marxism, in response to liberalism and the global system, has emerged by emphasizing class. It should not be forgotten that every theory emerges as a reaction “to correct what is wrong” in the global system. The answer is D."

    "explanation": "The broad areas and issues covered by the International Political Economy (IPE) discipline, whose source and formation are very old, can be explained in different ways by the different theoretical approaches of international relations. From this point of view, we can list the main approaches to help us explain IPE as<br/>Mercantilism/Realism, Liberalism and Marxism, and alternative approaches as Constructivism and Feminism. There are some concepts associated with these five theories. In the Realist approach, nation states, power, survival, security, and anarchy; in the Liberal approach, the individual, capital flows, open market, and invisible hand; in the Marxist approach, class, interest, exploitation, bourgeois, and proletariat; in the Constructivist approach, idea, norm, discourse, belief, and structure-maker relationship; and in the Feminist approach, concepts such as gender equality, sexist<br/>exploitation, and the end to oppression come to the fore. Since the theories of IPE are included as a separate section in the second part of this book, the theories here are explained in a short and concise way. The answer is B."

    "explanation": "Liberalism is the theory that emerged to respond to the facts and events that the security-centered and<br/>nation-state-oriented mercantilist/realist theory cannot explain. Liberalism as a concept means “liberty under the law”. Liberalism opposed mercantilism, which states that human nature is aggressive, offensive and skeptical, and argues that there is a constructive relationship between people competing for their own interests. This approach has been influential in the history of political and economic thought in the 18th and 19th centuries and is based on the concepts of equality, rationality, freedom, and property. In addition, this theory formed the basic philosophies of philosophers of the age of enlightenment. David Hume and Adam Smith from Scotland, Locke from England, Kant from Germany, Montesquieu and Voltaire from France were the ones who left their mark on this period. According to this approach, human (individual) is innately positive or can be educated. The answer is C."

Semi-periphery countries are characterized as both exploiting and exploited countries. Specifically, the core countries interact with the periphery and semi-periphery countries and transform them. Hence, Wallerstein defines the semi-periphery countries as transferring the information and technologies of the western states to themselves, starting to industrialize, and in this process they are both exploiting other countries, and being exploited themselves at the same time. In addition, the proponents of the world system theory share the same view with Lenin as the coreperiphery relationship ends with imperialism. The answer is A."

Many Americans then disagreed with the British classical economists’ argument for free trade and he was influenced by the Alexander Hamilton’s argument that the government should help to build up domestic industry. As a devoted German, he believed also that that was the best way to industrialize Germany(Kishtainy 2017).

    "explanation": "Physiocrats were the proponents of the new ideas of economic freedom in France. The term came from the ancient Greek word, “physiocracy,” meaning “rule by nature.” They also liked to call themselves the economists (Ebeling, 2016). During the time of physiocrats’ rein, France was trembled by the economic and social disorder, which eventually lead to French Revolution in the later phases. In such circumstances, physiocracy was a reaction to both industrial revolution and mercantilism. Physiocrats were striving for return to pre-industrial era (Beer, 2014, 13) and were interested in reforming France. Their reform program consisted of advancing several political reforms to remove all existing tariffs, taxes, subsidies, restrictions and regulations and to introduce a single nationwide tax on agriculture."

    "explanation": "The Physiocrats were French social reformers and their immediate influence in French economic and political affairs lasted about two decades and ended when their most politically influential member, Anne Robert Jacques Turgot ( 1727- 1781), lost the office of comptroller general of finances in 1776 (Hunt &amp; Lautzenheiser, 2011, 35). Francois Quesnay (1694-1774) was the most influential physiocrat. Physiocrats were generally acknowledged as having established the first systemic school of political economy even before Adam Smith (Charbit &amp; Virmani, 2002). They were also the first groups of economists who proclaimed “laisser faire laisser passer”, which later became the central theme of the liberal school.<br/>Physiocrats were the proponents of the new ideas of economic freedom in France. The term came from the ancient Greek word, “physiocracy,” meaning “rule by nature.” They also liked to call themselves the economists (Ebeling, 2016). During the time of physiocrats’ rein, France was trembled by the economic and social disorder, which eventually lead to French Revolution in the later phases. In such circumstances, physiocracy was a reaction to both industrial revolution and mercantilism. Physiocrats were striving for return to pre-industrial era (Beer, 2014, 13) and were interested in reforming France. Their reform program consisted of advancing several political reforms to remove all existing tariffs, taxes, subsidies, restrictions and regulations and to introduce a single nationwide tax on agriculture."

    },
    "explanation": "The origins of economic nationalism can be traced back to the work of Alexander Hamilton and Friedrich List. Alexander Hamilton (1755-1804) was the first secretary of the treasury of the United States. As such, he was a statesman rather than a theorist. However, his “Report on Manufactures,” which was submitted to the United States Congress in 1791, was an important classic economic nationalist text. In that report, Hamilton examined how to stimulate the US national economy. According to him, a national economy policy should aim at being independent (secure from external inference) rather than just accumulating material welfare. That is, the national economic goal ought to be to create a self-reliant economy rather than a wealthy economy. Hamilton saw active state intervention (or in a better word direct state involvement) as a must for the industrialization."

Agriculture was the supreme occupation not just because it was morally and politically superior to manufacture or commerce, but also it was much more productive than them; iv. Thus, those who engaged in agriculture were productive class while those who engaged in with non-agricultural activities were sterile classes (Meek, 2013, 20). The latter class is defined as sterile because it does not contribute to the creation of agricultural wealth; it only transforms it into consumer goods other than food or capital goods. The proprietary class consists of the king, the tithe holders, and the other landed proprietors."

The ‘invisible hand’ will find the most effective balance in the market instead of any central authority. That is, markets govern production, consumption, and exchange on its own in a best effective and efficient way. These are orders that, to Adam Smith, spring to life through the operation of an Invisible Hand; to F.A. Hayek, they are spontaneous orders; and to Paul Krugman, they are self-organising systems. Yet, there is room for the state in overseeing the proper functioning of markets, defending property rights, and for the provision of goods and services that markets couldn’t produce, such as national defence."

As the earliest systemic understanding of IPE, mercantilism goes back to the period between the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries. To understand mercantilism, we must look back to the eco-political environment of which the mercantilism was born out. Throughout that period mercantilism served both as a state policy and an economic theory. Mercantilists were also in cooperation with absolutist princes during an era of state-building out of the ashes of feudalism. Therefore, mercantilism was a strong nation-building policy as well as an economic policy. In this sense, it was not surprising to see that mercantilism first occurred in Britain and France, two of the successful absolutist states at that time."

For the purpose of structural reform, the National Bank Supervisory Board was formed, audits tightened, and banks’ credit and deposit services were restructured. Finance companies have been obliged to increase their equity and thus they are able to compensate the damage in difficult situations (Bocutoğlu &amp; Ekinci, 2009: 66).The reflection of the crisis on macroeconomic indicators was inevitable. The fall in house prices and the volatility in interest rates have emerged normally. However, growth rates decreased, industrial production decreased, trade slowed down, unemployment increased due to the effect of the bankrupt banks. As it can be understood from the figures only, the 2008 Mortgage Crisis is considered to be the first Global Crisis to take the whole world under influence (Kutlu &amp; Demirci, 2011: 125-127)."

    "explanation": "While Western Europe began to enter into capitalism and its market economy around 16th century onwards, the social relationships in Eastern part were not very conducive for broad market transactions. First agriculture was not very productive in the East and in order to compete with Western merchants and states, feudal rulers in Eastern Europe mostly chose to increase the burden of work and taxes over their serves. At that turning point in history, as market economy encouraged the development of civil initiatives and independent capital accumulation against feudal rulers in the West, general population in the East vastly suffered from growing pressure and restrictions on social and economic areas by their feudal landlords. Especially after the industrial revolution and overseas investments by Western capitalism, one can argue that there emerged a significant gap between two sides of the continent."

Though socialist planning increased the wel- fare of people in the first 50 years until 1980’s, it faced rising obstacles at the end of 1970’s as socialist economies left behind in technological innovation and producing more consumer goods. Western officials argued that, lack of incentives for innovation for individuals in socialist systems mostly resulted with bureaucratic inefficiency. Also lack of participation by the people into political and economic decision making through those seven decades further weaken the efficient operation of socialist planning."

    "explanation": "In terms of economic problems that Eastern European economies encountered during the transition to market economy, biggest issue was the lack of institutional framework. Eastern Europe populations did not have experiences with widespread market operations and associated legal regulations. For example, how to protect the private property rights of corporations and individuals after decades of communist era was not easy. In addition to that, economic policies that were advised by the IMF like privatization of state assets did not have necessary regulations that may prevent any plundering of public wealth during transition period. Also fast implementation of structural adjustment programs, i.e shock therapy, created mafia like organizations, who took advantage of those legal loopholes and even threatened the small property owners in the aftermath of the collapse of socialism. Countries, who politically controlled the market economy reform process achieved much stable results compared to hasty reform application of Russia in the 1990’s."

At that point China used its enormous labor force that can be mobilized for industrial production as the country contains almost third of world’s workforce. In addition to above arguments, one can count the existence of state control over strategic sectors in China as another fact that made Chinese transition more successful. Unlike hasty privatizations of 90’s Eastern European economies, Chinese ruling party preferred to control important sectors, such as telecommunication, energy, transportation and opted to privatize the most unproductive state enterprises. Also Chinese ability to learn industrial design and production techniques from foreign corporations helped countries economic development. Though, these Chinese practices were a lot of times accused by Western countries for being unfair trade operations."

    "explanation": "Poland was an exception compared to other countries in the bloc as it had milder authoritarianism because of earlier started resistance to full-scale Soviet control. After 1976 it’s civic associations, especially the Solidarity trade union, began its democratization demands against single-party government. Also in 1989, Polish regime under general Jaruzelski was the first in Eastern Europe in terms of initiation for democratic multi-party elections. That multi-party election framework was negotiated with the opposition groups. Poland created a semi-presidential system under Lech Walesa’s leadership and consolidated its democratic transition earlier than others. In Linz and Stephan’s words, this consolidation usually means that consecutive multi-party elections are held without significant disturbance and the country sees a change of leadership in that period of transition. Other issues that helped Poland in this relatively easier political transition were, first, Catholic church in the country had some autonomy from the Communist-led governments and began a culture of resistance with the help of papacy."

If we look at the features of the Chinese revolution in 1949, it was different from Soviet experience in terms of the dominance of peasants over the culture and politics of the country. So China did not develop even early Soviet democracy. Maoist largely accused the USSR in the 1950s for collaborating with the world capitalist system."

Ruling elite in China took the lesson from Soviet experience that without a sound economic structure, political and cultural reforms would cause unexpected turn of events, which the single party government can not control. One of the biggest examples of these policies was demonstrations in Tiananmen square in 1989. Chinese population saw that political openness of Gorbachev and his reforms in Eastern Europe and <strong>demanded the same political liberalization in China</strong> too, but Chinese bureaucrats were not ready to accept a transition to capitalism without their firm control. That was also a reflection of thousand years of Chinese political culture which mainly uphold the state and ruling elites’ interests far above the interests of ordinary Chinese. In 1989, first phase of economic reforms created imbalances between countryside and special economic zones in coastal areas. Unemployment, rising inflation, greater inequalities among party officials and masses, increasing corruption were all symptoms of political problems that surround China. In Tiananmen, ruling elite violently suppressed the demonstrators with around 1300 deaths but unlike the chaotic 1990’s in post-Soviet Russia, China passed the same era relatively calm. They even sped up the reform process in economy after 1992. Therefore, the correct option is B."
