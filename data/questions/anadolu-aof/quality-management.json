Quality has been related primarily to the products or services and their performances in the first stage. In the second stage, the focus shifted from production line to the process. In the third stage, the focus has moved from process to system. The fourth stage can be called as the Total Quality Management (TQM) stage, in which quality has become a more strategic issue and the focus is broadened towards the quality of the organization and its relationships with its environment such as customers, suppliers, competitors, and society at large."

It develops international standards and operates conformity assessment systems in the field of electrotechnology. In IEC, each country may be represented by a National Committee member. <br/>The TSE has been a full member of IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) since 1956, and attends some of the technical and sub-committees of IEC as a full member, and others as an observer member. The IEC’s certification body is a member of the IECEE / MC and CB. The TSE has been a member of IEC finance committee for many years. The national committees that are the members of IEC can participate in the technical committee work of their stakeholders as a participant or observer member. All national stakeholders in Turkey can participate in the international standardization activities through the Mirror Committee platforms. Observer members have access to committee documents and can participate in meetings, but cannot send experts to any working groups. When a participant member notifies its interest to participate in the committee activities, it is obliged to vote on the opinion documents of the committee concerned and attends meetings as much as possible. (IEC, 2019) <br/>https://www.iec.ch/members_ experts/refdocs/governing.htm.<br/>International Standardization Organization (ISO)<br/>International Standardization Organization (ISO), which develops and publishes international standards and to which Turkey also belongs as a member, is a non-profit organization with members from 164 countries. The TSE has been a full member of the International Standardization Organization since 1956. National standardization organizations, which are ISO members, can participate in the technical committee studies of their stakeholders as participant or observer members. All stakeholders at the national level can participate in international standardization studies through the Mirror Committee platforms in Turkey. Participating as an observer member, the member has access to the committee documents and can participate in the meetings, but cannot send experts to the working groups. Actively participating in the committee activities as a participant member, the member has the obligation to vote on the opinion documents of the committee concerned and has to attend the meetings as much as possible.

The concept of accreditation can be defined in different ways according to sectoral needs and the political structure, culture, and legislative structure of a country (Grossman, Sands &amp; Brittingham, 2010, p. 102). According to “European Co-operation for Accreditation” (EA) (EA, 2019, p.5):<br/><a href=\"http://www.european-accreditation.org\">http://www.european-accreditation.org</a>.<br/>“Accreditation provides the attestation that accredited bodies offering testing, examination, calibration, certification, inspection and verification services have the technical competence and impartiality to check the conformity of products and services with the relevant national and international standards.”<br/>According to another definition, accreditation means that an independent accrediting body evaluates the relevant institution or organization according to the field-specific standards and/or criteria, and formally recognizes or refuses the relevant institution or organization for a certain period depending on the positive or negative decision made at the end of the process. Following the definitions given above, we can list the characteristics of accreditation as follows: Accreditation is<br/><ul> <li>a way to ensure quality assurance,</li> <li>an independent external evaluation,</li> <li>a method of obtaining a quality certificate,</li> <li>a document that is not permanent and is valid for a certain period of time,</li> <li>an evaluation process,</li> <li>a process at the end of which an organization is decided to be accredited or not accredited,</li> <li>a process where the institution and the organization must prove that they operate according to the quality criteria used in the assessment,</li> <li>a process where, after receiving this document, institutions or organizations are monitored periodically,</li> <li>a process where, if requested by the institutions, the accreditation process is initiated.

This model is considered as a real tool for change and transformation for the organization<br/>Malcolm Baldrige Model: This model aims to raise the quality level of American organizations, to set the criteria both to guide and evaluate the quality improvement efforts of individual institutions, to identify the organizations that will set an example for quality improvement. Underlying the basis of this model are three important criteria: The effectiveness of the quality improvement approach, the quality management system, and customer satisfaction.<br/>The EFQM (The European Foundation for Quality Management) Model: With this model, the company’s strong and vulnerable areas are identified at regular intervals. In line with these findings, the company makes action plans for continuous improvement and aims to implement these plans. In other words, organizations determine their strengths and areas that are open to improvement, and they have the opportunity to improve their management approaches with the action plans they prepare. The model is essentially an institutional assessment tool that can be used by all organizations, regardless of size and sector."

    "explanation": "Change management is the ability of the business to produce new products and ideas and to develop new processes by managing the change process in order to achieve the goals of the business and reach the desired position in the future. For instance, durable goods manufacturers produce refrigerators that keep food fresh longer and consume less energy. The patterns on the ceramic tiles we use in kitchens and bathrooms are embroidered on the products with more sensitive printer-like machines instead of the old techniques. As in the examples above, change is not limited to goods and services produced in the enterprise or to production processes. In addition, change can mean changes in the way of doing things, in organizational structure, and in information flow in the organization. With change management, the business aims to reduce the risks and costs of all these changes."

Therefore, businesses must compete not only with enterprises in their own countries or regions, but with businesses all over the world.

Establishing a sense of urgency: A sense of urgency is necessary to mobilize people, to provide the<br/>necessary cooperation and to express the need for change.<br/>2. Creating the guiding coalition: After convincing people to take action for change, a team is formed<br/>to guide the process of change with sufficient talent, authority and skill.<br/>3. Developing a vision and a strategy: Guiding team develops a clear vision and strategy for change<br/>with other employees. Thus, the direction and means of change are determined.<br/>4. Communicating the change vision: The vision, tools, goals and paths of change are shared with all<br/>actors in the organization. Thus, a common understanding about change is tried to create.<br/>5. Empowering employees for broad based action: It means that all the factors that may prevent change<br/>are hindered. The employees and managers should be encouraged to take risks and initiatives so<br/>that all efforts of them contribute to the change. If necessary, they should get trainings.<br/>6. Generating short term wins: The change process should be divided to short terms and the improvements<br/>are measured in every term. The short-term achievements provide credibility, resource and morale for<br/>the change process. It provides feedback on strategies and allows changes if necessary.<br/>7. Consolidating gains and producing more change: Being committed to change is to try to realize the<br/>bigger changes that will carry out the vision without declaring an early victory with the climate of<br/>short-term gains.<br/>8. Anchoring new approaches in the culture: At the end of the change process, new practices create a<br/>new culture to ensure that the change is permanent. As a result of the process of change, new norms<br/>and values are created if the success of change has been proven."

The direction of the change activities of the businesses will undoubtedly be shaped by the opinions and behaviors of the consumers. For example, as a result of increased environmental awareness, many businesses have transformed their products and production processes in an environmentally friendly way. The annual goals of many businesses now include environmental sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. An example of how social trends affect business activities took place in the tourism sector in 2019. The fact that people started arranging their own travels via the internet played an important role in the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook, a 178-year-old British travel company. Since tourists have arranged their accommodation, air tickets and transportation in the country of destination, the need for travel agents has greatly decreased."

    },
    "explanation": "The reasons for resistance to change can be listed as follows (Buchanan &amp; Huczynski, 2017):<br/>Self-interest: We all have various habits and routines in our lives. Regardless of scale, every process of change replaces something old with the new. New business processes, new tasks, new products, new power relations and so on. These modifications change the whole routine in the business. As a result of the change, employees and managers may be concerned about the risk of losing their jobs, wages, qualifications and status. Change creates uncertainty in businesses where communication is not healthy, and employees are not well informed. Uncertainty for the future influences employee motivation and business performance negatively.<br/>Misunderstandings: In businesses where employees are not adequately informed about the causes and process of change, people may have wrong ideas about the causes and consequences of change.<br/>Different Evaluations: One of the issues that cause resistance in the change process is that everyone has different evaluations about the reasons, results, benefits and costs aspects of change. Some employees may say that costs outweigh the benefits. One way to create a consensus about the change is to share healthy data-based analyses and future forecasts with employees.<br/>Low Tolerance: We respond to the same events with different reactions. The process of change, which is fun and exciting for some of us, can be scary for others. This is due to our level of tolerance to change and the uncertainty it may bring."
