    },
    "explanation": "Although original Kemalist principles underwent various mutations, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s foreign policy views, like his political views, in essence represented a break with the past. His renunciation of the three grand ideas of the late Ottoman Empire (i.e. Pan-Ottomanism, Pan Islamism, and Pan-Turanism) with his principles Republicanism, Secularism, and Nationalism respectively had foreign policy implications. In this sense, his foreign policy was an extension of his domestic policies, recognizing the vital connection between the internal organization of the new state and its foreign policy (Váli, 1971: 55), and the fact that stable international relations needed for internal stability and domestic reforms he was planning."

    "explanation": "Italy and Mussolini, after 1925, started to develop ideas that could only be understood in terms of Italian aspirations for Turkish territories. Thus, when Mussolini declared at the 2nd Fascist Congress on March 19, 1934, that “Italy’s historical objectives are in Asia and Africa” and that “this should be considered a natural expansion”, this was understood as a threat to Turkey, though Mussolini claimed that “he had not meant Turkey, which he considered a European power” (Ataöv, 1965: 135-136). The disclaimer was far from reassuring, as 95% of Turkish territory was in Asia. His frequent references to the Mediterranean as Mare Nostrum (Our Sea) caused anxiety in Turkey, which became suspicious of the concentration of Italian forces around the Dodecanese islands, where a number of merchant-vessels were sunk by unidentified submarines starting from 1937."

    },
    "explanation": "Turkey did not emphasise the deterrence of its military power. It clearly stated other options to remain neutral.<br/>Turkey skilfully exploited disagreements both between the belligerents and within the Allied Powers to remain neutral in World War II. For example, at the beginning of the war, Turkey informed Germany that it distanced itself from the Axis Powers because of Italy's aggressive behaviour and demanded Germany to control Italy. On the other hand, when the non-aggression pact was signed between Germany and the Soviet Union in June 1941, Turkey played the Soviet threat card against German pressure. Turkey also used threats of invasion from the Axis powers or Russia as leverage against Allied pressure to enter the war. Until 1943, it cited the German threat as a reason for not entering the war on the side of the Allies, while in 1940 and after 1943 it cited the Soviet threat as a reason for not implementing the Triple Alliance. Due to Turkey's geostrategic position, the Allies generally had to accept Turkey's arguments for not entering the war, as an invasion of Turkey by Germany or the USSR would have serious consequences for the Allies. Even within the British government there were differences of opinion about Turkey's neutrality. For example, after the German invasion of Greece on 28 October 1941, the British Ministry of Defence wanted Turkey to enter the war immediately to strengthen Greek defences. However, the British Foreign Office thought that putting pressure on Turkey would increase Turkey's demand for arms at a time when Britain was struggling to meet even its own needs."

    "explanation": "The continental shelf does not only cover energy resources such as natural gas and oil.

According to this convention, the continental shelf is defined as the seabed and subsoil of the sea areas adjacent to the continental mainland and islands. The continental shelf may extend \"to a depth of 200 metres or, if deeper, to the point where the waters above it allow the exploitation of its natural resources\" (Article 1). However, the width of this area has always been a controversial issue. This is because coastal states are granted exclusive rights to explore and exploit mineral and non-living resources in these areas. The initially accepted criterion of \"exploitability\" was revised by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ stated that the continental shelf is a \"natural extension of the coastal State's landmass under the sea and into the sea\" and that this right exists <strong>i</strong>pso facto and ab initio (from the beginning). However, over time, it has become necessary to set a limit to the assumption that the landmass extends indefinitely into the sea in this way."

The area in question includes not only the body of water, but also the seabed, the waters above it and the subsoil. Coastal states have exclusive rights to explore, exploit, conserve and manage living and non-living natural resources within this area, as well as to engage in economic activities such as energy production from water, currents and wind. Coastal States may also establish artificial islands, facilities and structures within the EEZ, conduct marine scientific research, and protect and preserve the marine environment.<br/>According to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), coastal states are granted broad powers within the Exclusive Economic Zone.

In this way, there was no violation of the Convention.<br/>The aircraft carrier was purchased by China from Ukraine in 1998 and was planned to pass through the Turkish Straits en route to China. However, the Turkish authorities initially rejected this request, as they interpreted the Montreux Convention as prohibiting the passage of aircraft carriers. In response, China offered to send approximately two and a half million tourists to Turkey if the Varyag was allowed to be transferred to the mainland. In this context, China dismantled the Varyag's electronic systems, engines and rudder - elements indispensable for a ship - and technically transformed it into a \"floating object\". Thus, this object is no longer within the scope of the Montreux regime, but within the scope of Turkish domestic law. The Varyag was passed through the Turkish Straits in November 2001, accompanied by tugboats."

    "explanation": "Turkey’s relatively low material power compared to that of the non-traditional<br/>(except South Africa) and traditional middle powers gives it an advantage in<br/>interfering more actively in global issues through cooperation.<br/>• Turkey’s high trade dependence strengthens its middle power internationalism in the global economy with its increasing interest in reforming the major global financial institutions.<br/>• Turkey’s strong identification with the problems of global governance and its<br/>increasing degree of socialization in the cultures and values of the major<br/>international organizations also make it both a legitimizer (Cox and Sinclair, 1996:243; Cooper, Higgott, and Nossal:169) and a reform-seeker country. In the Turkish case, this duality of roles leads to a more active participation of Turkey in global governance pushing it to assume more global responsibilities.<br/>• Turkey’s relatively weak civil society seems to have not negatively impacted its recent activism in global governance since this activism mainly stems from the political decision-makers’ own strategic priorities and foreign policy choices."

    },
    "explanation": "Turkey’s global governance strategy has both commonalities and differences with that of other rising middle powers, traditional (Western) or non traditional. On the one hand, Turkey’s aspirations for a pluricentric, relatively cosmopolitan, and just post-Western world order, which can be easily observed in Turkish leaders’ various discourses, share a certain common ground with those of the so-called rising BRICS states. On the other hand, Turkey’s challenge to the existing international order is not structurally anti-Western. The intrinsic Western features of its identity and its historical institutional attachments to the West keeps Turkey, to a great extent, from using blocking or hard bargaining mechanisms against its Western allies."

    },
    "explanation": "After the G20’s establishment in 1999 on the side-lines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings on finance, Turkey initially adopted a pragmatic but relatively low-profile approach toward the G20 and avoided investing politically too much in the G20 as an international platform. Turkey’s policy entrepreneurship within the G20 has so far been weaker than that of other middle powers inside the G20. Here it must be reminded that Turkey’s inclusion in 1999 into the G20 came at a time when Turkish foreign policy had adopted a multidirectional and proactive approach in world politics, embedded in a new multilateral understanding reinforced specifically with the declaration of Turkey’s candidate status to the EU (Bagcı: 147-150). The 2008 global financial crisis provided Turkey with a new opportunity to actively participate in shaping the rules and institutions of the post-crisis global economy, as opposed to its previous standing as a peripheral partner and the passive compiler of rules imposed from above by the powerful core (Öniş, 2011: 55)."

    "explanation": "Turkey’s presidency for 2015 seems to have opened up a new era, not only for Turkey’s middle power diplomacy and activism toward the G20, but also for its unfolding nuanced stance vis-á-vis changing global governance frameworks. Ankara perceived the 2015 rotating presidency of the G20 as a major opportunity to display Turkey’s rising status at the international level as an economic and political power as well as to raise the profile of the G20 as a major global political economy platform. Despite the fact that the G20 was elevated to the leaders’ level only after the 2008 global financial crisis, it has functioned with a weak organizational structure; it does not have a permanent staff or general secretariat. Since the financial crisis, Turkey has been supporting the idea of establishing a permanent secretariat for the G20 and showed interest in quota reform within the IMF in order to increase the institution’s capacity (Legase and Kaçar, 2010: 133,138)."

During the first decade of the 2000s, Turkey’s active foreign policy agenda with its new ingredients such as mediation, conflict resolution, development aid, and humanitarian diplomacy, supported by the principle of zero problems with neighbors and a different civilizational and geopolitical understanding at the ideational level, have all led to the emergence of a new vision and strategy of global governance. Active participation in joint regional and international initiatives to address the emerging crises or ongoing conflicts have also affected the way and the extent that Turkey has involved in global governance during the last decade."

    "explanation": "Turkey’s ideological and institutional belonging to the Western bloc as well as its close relations with the U.S, the hegemonic power of the system during the first decade of the 2000s, brought it closer to the Western traditional middle powers seeking revision in the international system through strengthened cooperation arrangements and mechanisms in the formal and informal global governance institutions and forums. The increasing tone of Turkey’s criticism of the UN’s decision making mechanism and Erdoğan’s “the world is bigger than five” rhetoric may also be assessed in terms of its search for a just, equitable, and cosmopolitan international order that is capable of collectively responding to international crises and human tragedies in some chaotic regions of the world. The ambitious foreign policy agenda adopted by Turkey during the first decade of the 2000s and its 2015 G20 presidency gave a clear signal for its future preferences: to take an active place in less hierarchical G20-type forums, where developed and developing countries are equally represented and middle power countries have relatively more maneuvering capacity."

As a result of the escalation of Cold-War politics and repercussions of the bipolar international system between the US and the Soviet Union, Turkey seemed to have detached itself from its neighbors to the south-east, especially Syria and Iraq. Despite the signing of the Baghdad Pact in 1955, Turkey’s relations with Iraq deteriorated after a coup d’état had occurred in Iraq, which overthrew its monarchy and brought Arab socialism to power.

The “zero problems with neighbors” paradigm looked for peaceful solutions to various issues between Turkey and countries such as Greece and Armenia as well as several others in the Middle East and the Balkans. Turkey opted to enhance its international visibility as well as regional hegemony via developing its ties with international organizations.

    },
    "explanation": "The reconceptualization of security challenges as well as new geopolitical realities of the region have fostered Turkey to redefine and reinterpret its expectations and priorities (Kalın, 2012). The end of the bipolar international system and the emergence a new post-Cold War system have led Turkey to relocate itself in line with three principles. First of all, Turkish political elites have aimed at finding long-term solutions to the conflicts in the region and also to other long-lasting problems at the global level (Kalın, 2012: 9). The second principle of Turkish foreign policy has been to maintain a balance between “security” and “freedom.” The third pillar of Turkey’s new foreign policy lies behind the motive to cultivate political dialogue through economic instruments of trade and investment. Thus, the principles of Turkish foreign policy since the rise of AKP to power targeted to establish a regional hegemony through postulating new power capabilities, mainly in the form of soft power instead of hard/ material power."

    "explanation": "The concept of hegemony has been a part of international relations theory since the end of World War II, when the United States, as the leader of the new international system, to form an order with both incentives and occasional use of force. International organizations such as the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) all served first as agents of establishing order under US hegemony and later of stabilizing the political structure (Eralp, 1997). However, with the Vietnam War and the collapse of the Bretton Woods System in 1971 after the devaluation of the US Dollar by 10% under the Nixon administration, new debates on the decline of US power and hegemony surfaced in the theoretical discussion of international relations (Wallerstein, 1993).

      "E": "The decline of US power eliminated its global influence completely."
    },
    "explanation": "Realists have argued that the military power (hard power capabilities) and the military presence of the US around the world has marked the cornerstone of its hegemony and the hegemonic stability not only in the Middle East during the Cold War era but also in the international system. An American scholar, Robert Keohane, has defined a new approach to hegemonic stability. In his book After Hegemony, published in 1984, Keohane attempts to explain the influence of the US in world affairs in the post-World War II world, particularly focusing on the reasons for the decline in American influence by the early 1970s as well as how states achieve and retain international cooperation in a “post-hegemonic era.” In doing so, Keohane, as a neoliberal institutionalist, connects international political influence to certain causal mechanisms such as economic transformation, international regimes in specific issue-areas of international relations as well as specialized agencies (Keohane, 1984). Accordingly, the US continued to sustain its hegemonic position through its military and economic power as well as cultural and political influence until the early 1970s, at which point its power began to diminish considerably. Realists seek to understand the nature of US hegemony within the global system. Assessing the basis of the US power in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, Keohane argues that the US is not likely to continue to dominate the international system, but that the institutions that can be traced back to the start of the US hegemony will most likely survive. This is the era of, for Keohane, “post-hegemonic cooperation.”"

    "explanation": "A decisive moment regarding Turkey’s foreign policy toward the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and the Arab world, in particular, has begun to appear as a direct result of the newly emerging foreign policy strategy of the AKP. As Oğuzlu argues, “the concept of soft power underlines the significance of perceptions others hold vis-à-vis the agent/actor” (2007: 82). Originally rooted in the vision of Ahmet Davutoğlu, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and former advisor to the prime minister, of being a regional soft power, Turkey began effectively to emphasize its historical and cultural ties to the neighboring countries as well as to countries with Turkish minorities across Europe, Central Asia, the Caucasus and the Middle East. As Turkey’s regional influence grew, so did its economic strength, built in part on regional investments. Davutoğlu was the key architect of the AKP’s foreign policy doctrine; he described the key pillars of Turkey’s foreign policy toward the Middle East in his book Strategic Depth, published in 2001 (Davutoğlu, 2001;Tisdall, 2010). Although Turkey’s soft power, or the idea of Turkey as a “model” of Muslim democracy, lost much of its attraction during the second decade of the 2000s, Ankara has remained determined to exert its ideological and Islamist influence abroad (Altunışık, 2008)."

Therefore, the events that started in Syria in March 2011 gradually escalated into a proxy war, which posed a threat to not only the regional security and stability but also Turkey’s southern borders. The war in Syria, which has brought political, security, and humanitarian challenges, also destabilized the regional equilibrium. Since the onset of the protests in the southern city of Deraa, the basic parameters of Turkey’s policy with regard to the developments in Syria have centered on preserving both the territorial integrity and unity of Syria, ending the bloodshed in the country as well as bringing the political transition process to a peaceful conclusion that would meet the justifiable demands of the Syrian people (MFA, 2019a)."

    },
    "explanation": "When the Ottoman Empire conquered and took the island from its Venetian rulers in 1571, it was inhabited by Greek-speaking people. The Ottomans recognized the Archbishop of the Autocephalous Orthodox Church as the head of the Greek Cypriot millet. This made the Church central to the retention of Greek Cypriot ethnic, cultural and religious identity in the heterogeneous Ottoman Empire. Yet, the Ottoman millet system was showing signs of disintegration under the spread of sovereign, unitary nation-state ideas stemming from the 1648 Westphalian treaty which marked the start of the sovereign state system. The establishment of an independent Greek kingdom in 1830 by the revolt against Ottoman rule encouraged Megalo Idea that was to provoke more conflicts between Greeks and Ottomans. After crushing the Greek revolt, the vast Ottoman Empire was showing signs of disintegration, a process that began in the Balkans during the war with Russia and continued on and off from 1769, ending with the fall of Plevna in 1877-1879. This was to pave the way for Russia’s advance to the Ottoman Empire’s capital, İstanbul, a move viewed by the UK as a threat to its interests in India and its Middle East trading routes following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. An agreement was subsequently reached in 1878 by which the UK offered protection to the Ottoman Empire against further encroachments by the Russian Empire in exchange for certain concessions from the Ottomans allowing the UK to use Cyprus as a base to protect its interests. This did not stop the UK government from proclaiming the annexation of Cyprus on November 5, 1914, once the Ottoman Empire entered the First World War on the side of Germany."

    "explanation": "The 1923 Lausanne Treaty had helped achieve a balance between Turkey and Greece. However, Italy’s transfer through the Paris Peace Treaty of February 10, 1947 to Greece of 12 islands (which Italy first occupied during the 1912 War against the Ottomans and then ruled up to 1943) revived Megalo Idea among the Greek public. On February 28, 1947, the Greek Parliament decided to annex Cyprus. Turkey’s response was that the defense of Cyprus is not an issue for Turkey and nor should it be an issue for Greece. The then President of Turkey İsmet İnönü (1938 to 1950) preferred an isolationist foreign policy towards Cyprus within a framework that sought to remain committed to the Lausanne Treaty. This policy was apparent in statements of the then Foreign Minister of Turkey Necmeddin Sadak. On December 17, 1949, Sadak first said that Turkey recognized UK sovereignty over Cyprus with the Treaty of Lausanne and then, on January 23, 1950, said that Cyprus is not an issue for Turkey (Tahsin, 2018: 14).

    },
    "explanation": "The 1960 Republic of Cyprus (ROC) was not strictly a federal state, but rather a functional federation due to the characteristics derived from the republic’s bi-communal structure. Despite being a unitary state, the ROC’s constitutional provisions protected the political equality and political rights of Turkish Cypriots as one of the island’s two communities. Sözen (2004) states that the 1960 ROC was also referred to as a consociational democracy. The 1960 constitution provided the Turkish Cypriot community with a set of checks and balances that ensured political power was shared between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. The political equality of Turkish Cypriots, less than one-quarter of the population of the island, was guaranteed by the need for the consensus of both communities when it came to decision making. The Turkish Cypriot Vice President of the ROC had the right of veto in the executive and no decision could be taken in the legislative body without the agreement of separate majorities among the representatives of both parties in the legislature (Sözen, 1998: 24). The Constitutional Court was composed of a Turkish Cypriot judge in addition to a Greek Cypriot judge and a neutral president."

    },
    "explanation": "Once Turkish Cypriot officials left their positions in the Republic of Cyprus in 1964, Greek Cypriots unilaterally amended the constitutional provisions enshrined in the 1960 Republic of Cyprus and did so without the consent of Turkish Cypriots. Greek Cypriots legitimated their unilateral administration of the Republic of Cyprus using the doctrine of necessity to claim that there was an abnormal situation and that this justified maintaining the new state of affairs (Stavrinides, 1999: 26). They attribute this abnormal situation to the Turkish Cypriots by blaming them for seceding from the Republic of Cyprus as insurgents who revolted against the Republic of Cyprusand withdrew under pressure from their leaders to establish a separate state. As a result, the Greek Cypriot administration claimed that they represented the whole Republic of Cyprus and adopted an amended constitution accordingly. Since no-one challenges the legitimacy of this constitution, the status quo through the unilateral administration of the Republic of Cyprus continues. The accession of the Republic of Cyprus into the EU has been accomplished with a constitution, one-third of which has been amended unilaterally by Greek Cypriots."

Despite being a unitary state, the ROC’s constitutional provisions protected the political equality and political rights of Turkish Cypriots as one of the island’s two communities. Sözen (2004) states that the 1960 ROC was also referred to as a consociational democracy. The 1960 constitution provided the Turkish Cypriot community with a set of checks and balances that ensured political power was shared between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. The political equality of Turkish Cypriots, less than one-quarter of the population of the island, was guaranteed by the need for the consensus of both communities when it came to decision making."

    "explanation": "It was Turkey’s EU candidacy status in the 1999 Helsinki meeting and the pro-EU AKP’s (Justice and Development Party) coming to power with a revisionist agenda in 2002 that boosted Turkey’s support to the 2004 Annan Plan. While previous governments never had enough room for maneuver to challenge the status quo on the island since the problem first appeared on the agenda of the UN in 1964, the AKP government aimed to do so through a win-win model and from the perspective of Turkey’s EU membership. Thus, they supported pro-solution groups in Northern Cyprus by excluding Denktaş who was an antagonist to a federal solution based on the Belgium model that AKP’s leadership voiced at that time. However, it was not to offer any solid change for the future yet since, with the Greek Cypriots as representatives of the new EU member, they blocked any measure that might benefit the other side. So, attempts to bring justice to both communities were dashed. The TRNC carried on being embargoed by the international community. After 2004, the EU decided to establish a healthier relationship with Turkish Cypriots by integrating them closer to the union. In doing so, the EU adopted Protocol 10 as well as the Green Line Regulation and the Financial Aid Regulation. However, Protocol 10 has not opened a door for healthy dialogue with Turkish Cypriots due to the way that it makes a definition that completely isolates Turkish Cypriot authorities. Then, the Green Line regulation was implemented in a restricted manner. The Direct Trade and Financial Aid regulation could not be implemented since it was united and requiring unanimous vote."

He stated in his September 27, 2017 Report to the Security Council that the parties have achieved significant progress and these achievements need to be preserved. In the same report Guterres invited both parties to reconsider and make evaluations and added to include that the UN will be ready “to assist the sides, should they jointly decide to engage in such a process with the necessary political will, in order to conclude the strategic agreement that was emerging in Crans-Montana” (UNSG Report, 2017). Guterres outlined six key points in an attempt to encourage both parties to be creative in helping the restoration of negotiations implying some significant reconsideration in their methodology. The chief point in his report was that he distinguished a strategic agreement from a comprehensive settlement by implying that the former would be an element of a final package that would facilitate the latter. It was clear in his September 2017 report as well as the subsequent reports that his main target is to derive a strategic agreement in generally agreed principles and parameters in the six issues and that his framework, namely the Guterres Framework, “could form the basis for negotiations aimed at reaching a strategic agreement and paving the way for a “comprehensive settlement” (UNSG Report, 2018)."

The first is about the region’s proposed pipeline infrastructure to transfer natural gas as, for example, the gas forum formed by Egypt, Israel, Cyprus, and others in 2019 to jointly develop the most appropriate and viable infrastructure to best serve their collective needs. The second contentious issues concern the borders of so-called exclusive economic zones (EEZ) such as that declared by the Greek Cypriot administration through the various agreements it signed with Egypt in 2003, Lebanon in 2007 and Israel in 2010 (Stocker, 2012: 580).Turkey’s initial position was to argue that the Greek Cypriot administration had no right to negotiate and conclude international agreements unilaterally on behalf of the entire island. Notwithstanding this, the Greek Cypriot government began the process of exploratory offshore drilling for gas in September 2011. Accordingly, the TRNC proposed to the Greek Cypriots on September 24, 2011, that they both suspend the search for hydrocarbons simultaneously in the Eastern Mediterranean waters surrounding the island until settlement of the Cyprus problem (Anadolu News Agency, 2019). Turkey also officially declared that attempts by the Greek Cypriot administration to unilaterally permit drilling around the island would not be tolerated, asserting that the Turkish Cypriots also had a right to these resources. Turkish authorities began issuing navigational warnings (Navtex) and holding naval exercises and maneuvers, some off the coast of Cyprus. Added to this, the Turkish government signed a continental shelf delimitation agreement on September 19, 2011, with the TRNC identifying their respective continental shelves. Three days later the Turkish Petroleum Corporation was granted the right to begin drilling activities in the region. Turkey also began its own independent exploration of gas reserves off the coast of the northern part of the island, consistent with the license and the continental shelf of the TRNC (Anadolu News Agency 2019). Turkey bought its first seismic vessel, Barbaros Hayrettin Pasha, from Norway in 2013."

The main goal of the Mavi Vatan 2019 which was held in the Black Sea, Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean simultaneously was to send a clear message to Greece, Cyprus, Israel, and whoever else might be in dispute with Ankara’s declared interests in the Eastern Mediterranean. A Turkish officer spelled out the size and scale of the flotilla, “to reveal to the world that Turkish navy is capable of simultaneously fighting in three seas surrounding Turkey” (Soylu, 2019).
