    "explanation": "A French historian Fernand Braudel (1902-1985) was a “structuralist” who perceived human development to occur in three historical structures (“measures of time”): the quasi-immobile structure (la longue durée), the intermediate scale of “conjectures,” (rarely longer than a few generations), and the rapid time-scale of events. In his book, A History of Civilizations (French edition 1987, American edition 1993), he assumes that the history of human development is the history of civilization. Civilization for him is a process rather than a temporarily stabilized construct. He perceives one civilization as a human continuum or, depending upon the context, he may recognize hundreds of civilizations (for example, “Roman Civilization” or “Industrial Civilization”).

    "explanation": "Ever since religion was transformed from beliefs in magic to beliefs in poly-gods and then to a monogod, the cultural civilization has applied religion as the main tool of cultural control. The cultural civilization evolves into a civilization with challenges generated by intracivilizational and inter-civilizational issues of war and peace. These types of issues have been managed by technological means of domination. We will call such a civilization the infrastructural civilization. The infrastructural civilization’s purpose is to expand spheres of influence with the means of technology. Technology drives the development of infrastructural civilizations. The prime target of technology applications has been a war machine which supports the main values of a given civilization. By-products of military applications of technology affect the civilian part of its infrastructure. Among eight infrastructural civilizations, one can recognize the Sinic Civilization 2000 BCE, the Hindu Civilization 600 BCE, the Japanese Civilization 650 CE, the Western Civilization 800 CE, the Eastern Civilization 350 CE, the Buddhist Civilization 600 CE, the Islamic Civilization 632 CE, and the African Civilization since 1847 CE. \n<br/>The correct answer is C."

A nation is an entity which has a common language, culture, memory of historic events, and “national consciousness.” It does not mean that the nation must share a common territory. This condition is applied toward a state rather than toward a nation. In this model, a state is a category of a power infrastructure. However, the state creates the nation.

    "explanation": "Chiefdom is defined as an autonomous, socio-political unit which consists of several villages or communities under the permanent control of a chief with aristocratic ethos, but without formal, legal apparatus of forceful repression and without the capacity to prevent fission. Thus, the definition given for chiefdom in the option E does not correspond to the term 'chiefdom'. The definition “A few dozen people moving continuously in the search for food” corresponds to the definition of the term ‘band’. Therefore, the correct answer is E."

    },
    "explanation": "Egypt’s geographical location has been a source of confusion and an expression of psychological mindset among intellectuals and laymen. Some ask: is Egypt African, Middle Eastern, or European? Mazrui in his article entitled “On the Concept We are All Africans” stated that Africa is whatever the mind determines it to be; it is a state of mind or “the quality of thinking of oneself as an African” (Mazrui, 1963: 88-97). Egypt is an African land, but the greatness of its golden civilizations of the past is so gargantuan that it can only be described as an amorphous geographical entity encompassing the entire continent, but also containing the Western part of the Middle East, and the Sinai Peninsula. Cheikh Anta Diop on Ancient Egypt stated “Egyptian antiquity is to African culture what GrecoRoman antiquity is to Western culture. The building up of a corpus of African humanities should be based on that fact (Diop, 1990: 31). Arnold J. Toynbee on Ancient Egypt wrote “This notable society emerged in the lower valley of the Nile during the fourth millennium B. C. and it was without ‘parents’ and without offspring; no living society can claim it as an ancestor (Toynbee, 1947:30). The correct answer is D."

Therefore, he declared a law (known to history as the Edict of Telipinu) which concluded that the first male child born from the first wife of the king would be designated to ascend to the throne, primogeniture; if such a child was not available, then the next male child would become the king. If a king had no male child at all, then his eldest daughter’s son would become the subsequent king. This law, which King Telipinu issued with the approval of the Pankush, the Hittite Council of Nobles, was applied henceforth and it regulated Hittite ascension to the throne."

Regardless of whether Cyrus killed the Lydian king right away or befriended him, as Herodotus (who lived sixty years after Croesus) reports, these philosophically beautiful words were written by the Greek: “When asked by Cyrus, “Croesus, who advised you to attack my territories and meet me as an enemy not a friend?” Croesus said, “King, this is because of your good and my bad luck. The god of the Greeks is to blame, who gave me the arrogance to attack you. No one is crazy enough to choose war rather than peace.

    "explanation": "Hattushili III (1275 - 1250 BCE) ascended to the throne with Queen Puduhepa, who became one of the famous women in Hittite history. This couple alluded to divine powers in their acts. They made great use of religion in politics. Puduhepa placed her seal on many official documents either on her own account or together with the king, e.g. on the Treaty of Kadesh. Hattushili also attached importance to royal marriages and he had his elder daughter marry Ramses II of Egypt. Tuthalia IV (1250 - 1220 BCE) succeeded to the throne after his death; he was the son of Hattushili III and Puduhepa. A seal proves that the queen also continued to hold her title as the ruling queen (tavananna) during the reign of her son. This seal imprint is the only example wherein the name of the mother is given along with the name of the king. Diplomatically, there were good relations between the Hittites and the Egyptians. The most important problem of this period was a famine which broke out because of a severe drought. And this problem was solved thanks to the aid of the Egyptians. The correct answer is D."

Another view is that the Romans liked to believe that they were descended in a direct line from Ancient Greece, the major civilization that prevailed before them in Europe and the Middle East. Their main legend of origin was recorded in the great work <em>The Aeneid</em>, written by Virgil (70 - 19 BCE). According to this epic poem, Aeneas, a warrior of Troy and son of a prince of Troy and the goddess Athena, was a valiant fighter for the doomed city of Troy, but when the city finally fell to its besiegers, he led a band of his people westward to found, eventually and after much wandering, the city of Rome, a new homeland for his divine nation with its godly origins.

At that point, all of Gallia (today’s France and Belgium and parts of Western Germany) was within it, more of North Africa (but not that much) near Carthage, Cyrene (now in Eastern Libya), Syria, Cyprus, the Cilicia region, and the Bithynia region of Northwest Anatolia. Rome never effectively penetrated far to the south in Africa, so only the coastal regions in the north. As for Carthage, in 146 BCE, the siege after the second Punic War proved to be too much for the unfortunate Carthaginians; the destruction of the city of Carthage led to the final scene of the third Punic War. Out of an estimated half a million people in Carthage, only 50,000 survived. They were taken away as slaves by the Romans. The city was burnt to the ground and the ruins ploughed over.

    },
    "explanation": "When Christians refused to pay homage to Roman gods and the dead emperors, seen as gods by the Romans, the empire turned against them and advocating Christianity was punishable by death. When in 64 CE the city burned, the Emperor Nero unfairly blamed the Christians; many Christians were killed based on the false charge. Major persecutions of Christians followed in the early fourth century, led by the co-emperors Diocletian and Galerius, who saw Christianity as a threat to their rule. In 306 CE, Constantine converted to Christianity and became the Roman emperor. In 314, his Edict of Milan ensured tolerance for Christians throughout the Roman Empire. Julius Caesar lived before the emergence of Christianity (born 100 or 102 BCE). The correct answer is C."

    },
    "explanation": "Rome was led by Senators who legislated. The city was not to be ruled based on arbitrary decisions taken by a king, an autocrat, but rather on deliberation. The leaders themselves came from a group of advisers that Romulus supposedly had formed to guide him; their descendants became known as the patricians. They became the leading class of Roman citizens, a subgroup of about five percent of the population, and would ultimately constitute the men who were to serve at the helm of Rome for five hundred years during the Republic and, subsequently, the Empire. The importance of the Senate for Roman history cannot be emphasized enough; when looking around Roman monuments that still survive one will see stamped on them SPQR - <em>Senatus Populusque Romanus</em> (the Roman Senate and People). It can be found on coins, weapons, and anything possessed by the state. The correct answer is B."

    "explanation": "An interesting feature of the Roman government was the post of <strong>dictator</strong>. If there was a crisis at hand, the Romans could appoint a <strong>dictator</strong>, but his power could only last for six months. This, combined with the allocation of powers to plebeians as well as patricians, helped to guarantee stability while enabling Rome to handle crises. As an example, in 458 BCE Cincinnatus, a poor patrician was working on a small farm when the call from his country came. Although he questioned why he was being chosen, he accepted the request of delegates and was appointed temporary dictator so that he could rescue an army that had been surrounded by the enemy. Cincinnatus formed his army, engaged the enemy, and defeated it - all in fifteen days, seeing Rome through the emergency. He then resigned and returned to the farm, interested only in doing his duty, public service, not in grabbing political power or becoming rich or powerful. The correct answer is A."

He led his army in a huge attack on Italy, flanking the Roman heartland from the west and north. Hannibal brought with him an immense military force, complete with elephants, crossing the Alps. He then descended into Italy, winning huge victories at Lake Trasimene and Cannae, where he destroyed a Roman army twice his size. Rome barely survived because the military cleverly attacked Hannibal’s supply lines back in Spain and France - stretched thin as they already were - and disrupted those lines, keeping reinforcements from reaching Hannibal in Italy.

    "explanation": "Rome, while not a cultural desert, did not innovate in art, drama, or philosophy. However, Romans were leading in architecture by building beautiful cities and buildings, massive water works, roads that ran long distances, bathhouse, arches and domes. There also came the Roman rule of law, a gift that keeps on giving to civilized humanity to the present day. A uniform system of administration came with the spread of Rome’s domains, bringing tax collectors and others over the huge distances that often separated the capital from the provinces. Similarly, Roman sculpture was frequently found, especially in busts connected with worship of the emperors. The Romans imitated Greek sculpture but wound up with a unique mix, reflecting the huge growth of the empire. Some of their creations of stone and bronze were of the first rank. As Rome grew, did its sculpture, with ever larger works. They grew to be immense and often out of proportion. So, while the Roman civilization did not advance architecture or sculpture notably, it brought construction on a huge scale and built upon Greek and other antecedents, bringing beauty, form and function to the masses. The correct answer is B - Drama."

      "D": "The use of Greek language over time instead of Latin",
      "E": "The private armies owned by powerful landowners"
    },
    "explanation": "The controversy over the nature of Christ, the relationship between what was human and what divine in Christ caused disputes in the Byzantine world. It weakened permanently the Byzantine society’s cohesiveness. This contributed to weakening of the imperial defenses against the Muslims. The new theological controversies, which ran from the fourth century CE to the late seventh century CE, eventually led to the loss of the eastern provinces of the empire. As for choices B, C, and E, even though the latifundia system worked well at the beginning, it caused the landowners to gain excess power while the number of free military peasants decreased since the latter became serfs to rich land owners. Hence, the military of the empire weakened as soldiers became workers for the rich. The armies possessed by the wealthy posed a threat to the throne. On the other hand, even though Latin was the official language of early Constantinople, as it was of the entire Roman Empire, that language was replaced by Greek after the sixth century CE. Greek, which had long been the vernacular in Constantinople anyway, became the language of government in Byzantium. The Byzantine Empire was profoundly influenced by the Greek language, religious elements, literature and classical culture. As time went by Byzantine scholars and religious figures did not have to, nor did they tend to, learn to read Latin. While Greek culture had been central to the ancient Romans, and while the pagan religion of the Greeks had been adopted almost wholesale by the Romans, as Greek speakers located near Greece, the Byzantines were inspired much more deeply by the philosophy and literature of classical Greece than they were affected by the thinking and writing of classical Rome. Over time, Greek became the main language used. The Byzantines called themselves Romans but the language that was the medium in their empire became Greek. Therefore, although it had begun its work in the Latin language, it moved to Greek without causing major conflicts. The correct answer is D."
