(1) Volume of trade: Defining the key terms and concepts has to start with the term volume of trade. Volume of trade gives the total amount of imports and exports. Imports are the goods or services that are bought from a foreign country while exports refer to the goods or services that are sold to a foreign country. Thus, balance of trade gives the difference between total imports and total exports. If total imports are more than the total exports within an economy, then there is a trade deficit. On the other hand, when total exports exceed total imports, it means that there is a trade surplus."

Individuals in different countries may have different preferences or demands for various products. For example, the Indonesians are likely to demand more rice than Europeans, even if consumers face the same price. Turkish people may demand more yoghurt, the Dutch more beer, and the Japanese more seaweed than Indians would, even if they all faced the same prices.</li> <li>Existence of Economies of Scale in Production: The existence of economies of scale in production is sufficient to generate advantageous trade between two countries. Economies of scale refer to a production process in which production costs fall as the scale of production rises.</li> </ol> 5. Existence of Government Policies: Government tax and subsidy programs alter the prices charged for goods and services. These changes can be sufficient to generate advantages in production of certain products. In these circumstances, advantageous trade may arise solely due to differences in government policies across countries."

    "explanation": "THE RISE OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE THEORY AND MERCANTILISM<br/>During the mercantilist period, nation states were established instead of feudalism. The official economic doctrine of the newly established nation-states was mercantilism. According to mercantilism, the main objective of foreign trade policy is to increase the gold stock (Krugman, Obstfeld, Melitz, 2017, p. 26). It was the interventionist system that focused on export in order to increase the gold and silver reserves. They gave importance to increase export, thus foreign trade surplus. On the other hand, they prohibited the import of products. Imports of raw materials were free. Traders also attached great importance to the development of the trade fleet to increase gold inflow.<br/>According to the mercantilist doctrine, countries should export more than they import. World wealth (gold or silver stock) is constant and cannot be increased. Therefore, there is always a contradiction among the foreign trade countries. While one side of trade is profitable, the other party suffers equally. Mercantilists assumed trade was a zero-sum game that it could not be mutually beneficial to all parties. Mercantilism is an economic theory that holds that the prosperity of a nation is dependent upon its supply of capital, and that the global volume of international trade is “unchangeable”."

Trade improved the allocation of labour, ensuring that each good would be produced in the country where the good’s production required the least labour. Result would be a larger total quantity of goods produced in the world. Trade would be a positive-sum game. A country has an absolute advantage in the production of a good relative to another country if it can produce the good at a lower cost or with a higher productivity. If the input prices are the same in both countries, the country with an absolute advantage will have lower unit production cost for that good. A country should produce and export products in which it has an absolute advantage, and a country should import products in which it has a disadvantage."

    "explanation": "Theory of Comparative Advantage<br/>The comparative advantage law is one of the most important laws of economy, as it is useful for individuals as well as for nations, as well as for revealing many serious fallacies. Comparative advantage is the cornerstone of international trade theory. Origins of the theory Comparative advantage was first described by Robert Torrens in 1815 in an essay on the “Corn Laws”. He concluded it was England’s advantage to trade with Poland in return for grain, even though it might be possible to produce that grain at a lower cost in England than Poland. However the term is usually attributed to David Ricardo who explained it in his 1817 book “The Principles of Taxation and Political Economy”. To be simple, assumptions will initially refer to only two countries and two commodities like in absolute advantage theory. Trade can also rely on other causes, such as large-scale production and product differentiation. The theory of comparative advantage is an economic theory about the potential gains from trade for individuals, firms, or nations that arise from differences in their factor endowments. Moreover, the comparative advantage of nations may change over time as a result of technological change.<br/>A question may arise here. If a country has absolute advantage in all products and the other country is absolutely less productive, then wouldn’t international trade occur? According to David Ricardo, there is no need to rely international trade on absolute advantages. The key word here is comparative, meaning ‘relative’ and ‘not necessarily absolute’. They both can gain by trading with each other as long as their relative disadvantages in making different goods are different. A country has a comparative advantage when it can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country; alternatively, when the relative productivity between goods is the highest compared with another country."

A country gains more from trade if it receives a higher price for its exports compared to the price that it pays for its imports. For each country, trade gains depend on the country’s international terms of trade, which are the price the country receives from foreign buyers for its export products, relative to the price that the country pays foreign sellers for its import products (Pugel, 2015, p. 59)."

Technology refers to the techniques used to turn resources- labour, capital, land into outputs -goods and services.</li> <li>Differences in Resource Endowments: Advantageous trade can occur between countries if the countries differ in their endowments of resources. Resource endowments refer to the skills and abilities of a country’s workforce, the natural resources available within its borders-minerals, farmland, etc., and the sophistication of its capital stock (machinery, infrastructure, communications systems).</li> <li>Differences in Demand: Advantageous trade can occur between countries if demands or preferences differ between countries. Individuals in different countries may have different preferences or demands for various products. For example, the Indonesians are likely to demand more rice than Europeans, even if consumers face the same price. Turkish people may demand more yoghurt, the Dutch more beer, and the Japanese more seaweed than Indians would, even if they all faced the same prices.</li> <li>Existence of Economies of Scale in Production: The existence of economies of scale in production is sufficient to generate advantageous trade between two countries. Economies of scale refer to a production process in which production costs fall as the scale of production rises.</li> <li>Existence of Government Policies: Government tax and subsidy programs alter the prices charged for goods and services. These changes can be sufficient to generate advantages in production of certain products. In these circumstances, advantageous trade may arise solely due to differences in government policies across countries. </li> </ol> The correct answer is E."

    "explanation": "Export subsidies are also payments made by a government in order to inspire the export of specified goods. As with taxes, subsidies can also be imposed on the basis of specific or ad-valorem. Agricultural and dairy products are the most common product groups where export subsidies are implemented. It is important to know that the subsidy is applied to the exported part of goods, not to the whole of its local production. In this way, the manufacturers or producers will turn to foreign sales more than their domestic sales. The subsidies for this purpose are varied such as tax rebate, direct premium payment, cheap credit and cheap input to export-oriented industries. Export subsidies can be regarded as a form of dumping. Although export subsidies are not legal by international accord, many countries provide them in disguised and not so-disguised forms"

    "explanation": "Voluntary export restraint is a restriction set by a government on the volume of products that can be exported to other countries during a specified period of time. This barrier is one of the most important nontariff trade barriers among other nontariff restrictions. Sometimes, the word voluntary is considered in quotes because it is implemented upon the insistence of the importing nations. Typically, VERs arise when the import-competing industries seek protection from an augmentation of imports by particular exporting countries. Then, the exporter offers VERs in order to satisfy the importing country and to avoid the impact of possible trade restraints on part of the importer. Thus, VERs are seldom completely voluntary."

In this respect, China’s foreign policy constituted on the grounds of military power to protect the Silk Road in the third century BC is a substantial example. International trade has played a very dominant role during both the war and peace times and constituted the hub of economic cooperation among countries. Each of these early developments has helped to the signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, which is accepted as the first solid base of today’s multilateral trading system.<br/>Apart from those early steps, II. World War constitutes a landmark on the realization of GATT, which is the predecessor of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It’d be sufficient to have a look at the daring meeting of Churchill and Roosevelt in 1941 to remember how economic cooperation nominates peace and security. This meeting of Churchill and Roosevelt in 1941 paved the way for the famous Atlantic Charter, which was a policy statement of the allies. Certainly, the examination of the Atlantic Charter is out of our scope but mentioning the 5th Clause would be useful to remind the importance of economic cooperation in constructing peace and democracy. The 5th Clause of the Atlantic Charter foresaw fullest cooperation between all countries within the economic matters (United Nations, 1941). Certainly, it is adequate to state that the end of the II. World War gave the opportunity to the Allies to re-shape the international legal, political and economic environment. Post-war international legal and political environment have been designed upon the rules and legislation of the United Nations and International Court of Justice. On the other hand, economic environment was proposed to be constructed upon the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and International Trade Organization (ITO).<br/>Since the legal and political re-shaping during the post-war period is out of our scope, we are content with giving brief information on the international economic environment and its main organizations. In this respect, we have to remind the Bretton Woods Conference held in July 1944 so as to discuss postwar international economic order. Bretton Woods Conference ended with the conclusion of establishing the World Bank, the IMF and the ITO, which correspond to a three-pillared structure for the post-war international economic order. These new-proposed institutions were referred to Bretton Woods Institutions.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is D. The World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and International Trade Organization (ITO), which were referred to Bretton Woods Institutions correspond to a three-pillared structure for the post-war international economic order. The information about the other options:<br/>The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) signed in 1947 is accepted as the first solid base of today’s multilateral trading system. The GATT is neither an international organization nor an institution. It is simply an international agreement. GATT is the predecessor of the World Trade Organization."

In spite of the benefits and positive welfare effects, reduction within the trade restrictions or in other words, trade liberalization, can be painful. Due to the adjustment requirements, abolishment of the trade restrictions might be time demanding. Thus, the GATT/WTO allows member countries to implement the required trade liberalization gradually, leading to a progressive trade liberalization. In this respect, least developed and developing countries are given longer periods to implement their necessary progressive trade liberalization.</li> <li>Predictability Principle: This principle is about not to raise a trade restriction that is decreased or abolished before. The countries that decide to open up their markets bind their commitments. These commitments take the form of import tariff ceilings on commodities trade. In this case, the bound commitment refers to bound tariff. Countries can change their bindings if they take the assent of all the other GATT/WTO member countries. It means that they have to persuade them via companseting their probable losses. Although there is a probability to alter the bindings, it is not that easy to put it into practice.</li> <li>Promoting Fair Competition Principle: Multilateral trading system is not just a free trade system but also a system of fair competition. Fair competition can be distorted by dumping and subsidies. The additional duties charged by the countries that are exposed to dumping and subsidized exports can be very unfair, as well. Promoting Fair Competition Principle helps in avoiding unfair anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties.</li> <li>Encouraging Economic Development and Reform Principle: The multilateral trading system has various goals, rules and implementations. Nevertheless, the countries within the multilateral trading system are not homogeneous in economic terms. Thus, they should not be treated equally in adopting the rules and implementing the decisions of the system. Thus, least developed and developing countries are subject to a time flexibility in adopting and implementing the requirements of the multilateral trading system.</li> </ol> As also understood from the information given, all of the principles in the options are the main principles of both the GATT and the WTO, so the correct answer is E."

    "explanation": "Although the WTO is the perpetuation of the GATT aiming to reach common multilateral goals, it has its own fundamentals that are mostly the improved versions of the GATT system. The fundamentals of the WTO can briefly be examined under four subtitles:<br/><ul> <li>Setting multilateral trading rules: There is no doubt that multilateral trading rules ensure assurance, transparency and economic stability. Consumers as well as producers enjoy the confidency of supplies and the vast variety of manufactured commodities, inputs and raw materials. The traders know that the markets are open to them with uniform trading implementations. Such a system that functions on the grounds of multilateral trading rules conceives a more accountable world economy. Multilateral trading rules are taken by consensus among all the WTO member countries and ratified by their parliaments. Thus, a multilateral trading rule cannot be implemented if a member country does not give assent. The driving forces of the multilateral trading system are the agreements negotiated and signed by the WTO member countries and ratified by their national parliaments. These agreements constitute the legal basis of the multilateral trading system.</li> <li>Trade negotiations: In setting the multilateral trading rules, trade negotiations have been the main instrument of the system since the signing of the GATT in 1947. The basis of today’s multilateral trading system has been laid down by a series of trade negotiations, or as sometimes referred as, trade rounds.</li> <li>WTO agreements: The multilateral trading system that is represented by the WTO is based on the agreements. In other words, multilateral trading rules get their binding from the WTO agreements. In this respect, the WTO agreements constitute the structure of the WTO. Since they require an explicit explanation, they are examined under the following title of the Structure of the WTO.</li> <li>Building trade capacity: Among the total 164 WTO member countries, over threequarters are developing or least developed countries. The WTO agreements entail special provisions for developing or least developed countries by taking into consideration their economic structures and needs. These special provisions mostly offer longer time frames in implementing the WTO commitments, facilitating their trading opportunities, assisting and giving them support in building trade infrastructure in order to take more part within the world trade.</li> </ul> As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is E.

    "explanation": "The multilateral trading system that is represented by the WTO is based on agreements. The WTO agreements are the outcomes of negotiations. Today’s WTO agreements are largely depend on the conclusions of the Uruguay Round.<br/>The structure of the WTO is based on five pillars:<br/><ul> <li>The first pillar, trade in commodities, has been the founding framework of the multilateral trading system. As explained before, the GATT signed in 1947 has been the fundamental basis of the multilateral trading system in commodities. Then, the GATT 1947 was revisited at the Uruguay Round and referred as the GATT 1994. However, some commodities require specific regulations. Thus, they are configurated by separate agreements and annexes under the GATT 1994.</li> <li>Trade in services, which is the second pillar of the structure of the WTO, was not a subject of the GATT 1947. It is regulated by the GATS (General Agreement on Services Trade) within the structure of the WTO. The agreements and annexes under the auspices of the GATS are on movement of natural persons, shipping, telecommonication, air transport and financial services. Like in the GATT 1994, they constitute the integral part of the GATS.</li> <li>Third pillar of the structure of the WTO is the TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights). It is the most comprehensive agreement on intellectual property rights. TRIPS covers: (1) copyright and related rights such as performers’ rights, producers of recordings and broadcasting set ups, (2) trademarks, (3) geographical indications, (4) industrial designs, (5) patents, (6) layoutdesigns of integrated circuits, (7) undisclosed information (WTO, 2019c). Intellectual property rights had not been dealt with the GATT 1947. It is the TRIPS that has regulated the intellectual property rights for the first time at the multilateral level.</li> <li>Fourth pillar of the structure of the WTO is the Trade Related Dispute Settlement. It usually refers to one of the most important innovations of the Uruguay Round. However, we should avoid a misunderstanding: Stating the Trade Related Dispute Settlement as one of the most important innovations of the Uruguay Round, we do not mean that it is a newly starting system. Conversely, there was a dispute settlement mechanism with the GATT 1947, based on Article XXII and Article XXIII of the GATT 1947. Nevertheless, the structural weaknesses due to the inherent circumstances led to an increased number of unresolved trade problems among the GATT 1947 countries. Thus, the GATT 1947 countries had to improve the dispute settlement mechanism at the Uruguay Round.</li> <li>The fifth and the last pillar of the structure of the WTO is the Trade Monitoring. Trade Monitoring is achieved by the Trade Policy Review Mechanism. The aim of the Trade Policy Review Mechanism is to assist efficient adherence of all the WTO member countries to the rules and procedures of the WTO as a whole. The main function of the Trade Policy Review Mechanism is to evaluate the effects of the trade policy implementations of the WTO member countries on the multilateral trading system. It also leads to a greater transparency within the trade policies of the WTO member countries.</li> </ul> As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is E. The structure of the WTO is based on five pillars."

    "explanation": "When countries come together and form economic collaborations, they may decide to go beyond a simple economic cooperation and pool their economic resources to get the benefits of an integrated economy. Nevertheless, the more the countries get integrated, the more they lose their domestic control over the economic decisions. Decisions to integrate the economies of countries are often taken in stages. Thus, the economic integration initiatives are examined by stages mostly referred as types of economic integration. Theory of economic integration examines the economic effects of each economic integration type.<br/><ul> <li>At the bottom of the economic integrations pyramid, there is the preferential trade agreement, referring to the first stage of economic integration. Preferential trade agreement is the loosest type of economic integration in which the areas that require common decisions and implementation of the participant countries are minimum. In this type of economic integration, the basic aim is to foster the international trade among the participant countries in some certain industries.</li> <li>The next stage within the economic integration is the free trade area. In a free trade area, member countries abolish all trade restrictions on each other’s commodities but continue to implement their own trade policies to the countries that are outside the free trade area.</li> <li>The third stage/type of economic integration is customs union. Member countries of a customs union abolish all trade restrictions among themselves and implement a common external trade policy toward the third countries. Moreover, the customs union member countries act together as a single entity during the negotiation and conclusion of trade agreements with other countries (third countries). The implementation of common external tariff avoids the possibility of trade deflection or transshipment. Certainly, it is one step further through a deeper integration. Member countries leave their independence in deciding and implementing their own tariff rates.</li> <li>The fourth stage/type of economic integration is common market. All trade restrictions are abolished among member countries. In addition to the free movement of goods, free movement of services, labor and capital are also achieved. In other words, there are four freedoms within a common market. There is no doubt that common market is a higher level of economic integration. Member countries give up their sovereignty in most of the economic policies related with the four freedoms. Common market also requires additional common economic policies that help well-functioning of the economic integration, such as common competition policy, common indirect taxation policy, common consumer policy, common environmental policy, common e-commerce policy, etc.</li> <li>The last stage/type of economic integration process is the economic and monetary union. Certainly, it is the most comprehensive type of economic integration. Economic and monetary union encompasses all the features of the common market and goes further to unify of all the economic institutions.</li> </ul> As also understood from the information given, the correct order of the economic integration types from the loosest to the most comprehensive is in the option E, so the correct answer is E."

    "explanation": "Theory of economic integration analyzes the economic effects of economic integrations. Theory of economic integration is developed upon the welfare effects of customs union. The welfare effects of customs union are introduced by Jacop Viner in 1950. In his book The Customs Union Issue, Viner examines the static effects of customs union. Static effects are the effects that occur at the time of establishment of the customs union. Static effects of customs union are called trade creation and trade diversion. Static effects of customs union They emanate at the formation of the customs union. Thus, they represent very short run effects. The static effects of customs union take into consideration only the welfare within the highest cost country. The static effects of customs union are sometimes referred as Vinerian customs union theory. Next to the static effects, there are also dynamic effects of customs union. Dynamic effects are long run effects. They arise due to increased competition within the customs union, higher level of technology, economies of scale, induce to foreign direct investments and better allocation of economic resources. Let’s give brief information about these dynamic effects:<br/><ul> <li>Increased competition: Before the establishment of customs union, producers may enjoy the protection behind trade restrictions. Along with the establishment of customs union, trade restrictions among the member countries are abolished. Thus, producers have to be more efficient so as to compete with the identical commodities of the other member countries. Due to the increased competition, costs of production will be decreased, leading to a decrease in prices. Consumers will enjoy the lower prices that were the outcomes of increased competition.</li> <li>Higher level of technology: Increased competition will lead to seeking higher level of technology. Since producers would like to rise efficiency in order to meet the increased competition, they would demand higher level of technology within their production. Thus, customs union would stimulate the improvement and utilization of new technologies. At the end, consumers will be better off with decreased prices.</li> <li>Economies of scale: It may result from the enlarged market effect of customs union. A country entering a customs union will begin to produce for the customs union market that is larger than its domestic market. Increased amount of production will lead to economies of scale that will lower the costs and also prices. Like in the previous dynamic effects, consumers will be better off from the economies of scale.</li> <li>Induce to foreign direct investments: Enlarged market that is formed along with the customs union may attract the attention of potential investors. Investors who would like to meet the advantages of increased competition and economies of scale will invest within the customs union member countries. Increased foreign direct investments will also help the adjustment of balance of payments deficits of the member countries, if any.</li> <li>Better allocation of economic resources: In a customs union, member countries produce the commodities or services in which they have a comparative advantage. Specialization that arises from comparative advantage will lead to better allocation of economic resources. Not only the member countries but also the world will be better off with adequate allocation of limited economic resources.</li> </ul> As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is E. The dynamic effects of customs union are increased competition within the customs union, higher level of technology, economies of scale, induce to foreign direct investments and better allocation of economic resources."

The IMF also gives policy assistance to member countries and promotes economic policies that would enhance economic stability, strengthen the economy for the negative effects of economic and financial crises and increase standard of living. (2) Financial assistance: One of the main responsibilities of the IMF is to give financial assistance to the member countries facing balance of payments problems. Member countries that have balance of payment deficits or surpluses prepare adjustment programs through close cooperation with the IMF. The IMF provides financial assistance upon the implementation of the adjustment program. In other words, financial assistance is subject to the implementation of the adjustment program designed in collaboration with the IMF. (3) Capacity development: The other main mission of the IMF is to assure technical assistance and training to support member countries to construct stronger and more efficient economic institutions and human capacity. Establishing more vigorous policies for taxation, monetary and exchange rate policies, supervision and regulation of banking and financial institutions, legislative systems, statistics and reporting (IMF, 2019a)."

Since the size of these effects depends on the monetary policy followed in the country (the degree of sterilization), without technical details, we can conclude that short term capital flows affect <strong>the quantity of money, interest rate (therefore foreign exchange rate) and general price level in the country</strong>. Therefore, the correct option is C."
