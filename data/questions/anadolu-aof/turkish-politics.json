    "explanation": "After the year 1945, a time when USA domination of the world began to shape political affairs at a global scale, “political science” or “politics” has theoretically employed a paradigm, which took politics as a tool of governance to solve practical and technical problems, thus there politics is confined to a mere organon, and generally understood as a system in which political inputsare transformed into political outputs, thus paving the way for a political situation in an advanced capitalist society where citizens are conditioned as costumers economically, and as voters politically, leaving aside all cultural, historical and sociological elements that are embodied in society as conflicts and contradictions. As can be understood from the information given, the correct answer is D. The informaton related to the other years in the answer choices are as follows:<br/>1871: Kulturkampf, (German: “culture struggle”), the bitter struggle (c. 1871-87) on the part of the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck to subject the Roman Catholic church to state controls.<br/>1873: The term “Kulturkampf” came into use in 1873, when the scientist and Prussian liberal statesman Rudolf Virchow declared that the battle with the Roman Catholics was assuming “the character of a great struggle in the interest of humanity.<br/>1932: The People’s Houses, Halk Evleri, were established in 1931/32.<br/>1950: The relative transition to parliamentary democracy in 1950 opened the door for other ideological inclinations, such as socialism and liberalism, which both had a relatively weak tradition in Turkey."

Turkey as a country and society is not an exception to this determination. So we have to understand politics as it has been constructed, produced and reproduced in political imagination. There are certain limits to that imagination. And they come most from actual and historical factors. Every society is a society of its own history, in other words, every society is a product of its own history. With this unique “historical” touch, politics and its elements in every society have been overdetermined from the very beginning.

The list includes an indefinite dichotomy, and it could go further. Subject in this sense dissolves in many figurations based on social, political, cultural and gender differentiations. Subjectivization is a process the subject becomes itself, but the moment subject accepts itself as it is, an objective crack appears between subject and its representation. This failure accomodates acts of subjectivization through which subject tries to redefine, rebuild and reasserts itself on the political scene. Subjectness is not a permanent position, and it is not a solid configuration which does not change. Therefore a “voter” is not simply someone who just gives his/her vote, and then settles down. A “worker” is not someone who just works at workplace and continues to do so. An ideologically motivated person in a political movement has also a daily life to deal with. A woman is not just a woman with only a biological disposition to rely on, but she has also other features to be defined.

When the land system, based on the production of small peasants and a subsistence economy began to be dissolved principally because of the corruption caused by the Sipahis, the control of the land was captured by the landlords and the Christian notables; and millions of peasants experienced harsh conditions.

Large farms and mansions now replaced the small peasants in this phase. The development of large farms has another meaning for Ottoman economic and social life. The ayans or local notables were considerably strengthened in the system. The empowerment of the ayans is also related to the increase in the demand for agricultural products from abroad (Europe) and the relative liberalization of trade. Consequently, the ayans became a highly effective power in the last decades of the 18th century. Therefore, the correct option is A."

The Young Ottomans were frequently in disagreement ideologically. They have quite different ideas regarding the apprehension and solution of current problems. In contrast, their common characteristics consist of their opposition to the leading political actors and practices of the Tanzimat Era. The young Ottomans achieved their objectives on the adoption of the constitutional monarchy on 23 December 1876. Abdülhamid II promulgated the Ottoman constitution of 1876, namely Kanun-i Esasi."

Although there were a few Dönmehs (Who converted publicly to Islam), in practice, there were no Christians among them. Almost all of them lived in the cities. The majority were of Macedonia or İstanbul origins. Beyond all these characteristics, there were severe differences in the social backgrounds of the Young Turks. For example, while it was possible to encounter the offsprings of large land owners and children of the Pashas, it was also possible to notice those of merchants and officers. As emphasized earlier, most of them were trained in modern educational institutions. They generally spoke at least one foreign language, which was usually French. Finally, most of the Young Turks were government officials. There were civil servants, doctors, postmen, and teachers among them. On the other hand, it is necessary to remark that most of the prominent Young Turks are from the military"

The “Republican” word in the name was particularly important because the founders of the Party declared that they were not against the republican regime by using this statement. On 5 May 1925, the Ankara Independence Tribunal requested that TpCF to be closed by claiming that the provincial organization of the Party was involved in Sheikh Said Rebellion and supported the rebels. On June 5, 1925, the government announced that the TpCF was closed together with all its provincial organizations. The government claimed that TpCF cooperated with reactionary powers and strived to restore the Sultanate. Many members of the TpCF were prosecuted and imprisoned. Thus, the first attempts of the transition to a multi-party period ended in a short time."

      "E": "II, IV and V"
    },
    "explanation": "In 1930, there was a second attempt to adopt a multi-party democracy through the foundation of another opposition party. Nevertheless, the opposition party was not established in its own dynamics. At the time, Atatürk requested that Fethi Bey (former Prime Minister), who was the Paris embassy, establish an opposition party with a liberal program. Atatürk requested from his sister Makbule Hanım and some CHP deputies that they register as members of the new party. Atatürk promised the Liberal Republican Party (Serbest Cumhuriyet Fırkası-SCF) founders that he would be impartial against both parties as the President of the Republic. SCF produced a significant impact in a short time. A large number of citizens from different areas applied to the party for becoming a member. The party completed its domestic organization in a short time. However, the growth of the party in a short time led to negative consequences for its political future. SCF participated in the local elections in October 1930, and won 30 out of 502 municipalities. The claims that the results of the elections were dishonest, made by the party’s leader, Fethi Bey, raised the tension considerably in politics. Some CHP leaders claimed that the new party posed a threat to their power. The tension between these two parties and the unease in his own party worried Atatürk as well, and he told Fethi Bey that he was the leader of CHP and would no longer remain neutral. This situation alarmed SCF leaders, particularly Fethi Bey. Therefore, in November 1930, SCF dissolved itself. He returned to diplomacy. One of these reasons why this opposition party was made to be founded by Atatürk was presumably to eliminate the dissatisfaction arousing within the country at the time. Indeed, the reforms in the early years of the Republic have caused dissatisfaction in the wider social sectors. Furthermore, economic difficulties in the country continued. Accordingly, it could be argued that the regime needed a controlled opposition (Zürcher, 2018, p. 211). In addition, the establishment of an opposition party was a functional tool for giving an image of a democratic country to the world. Nevertheless, it was unexpected that the SCF would grow in such a short time. Therefore, the attempt to create an opposition under the control of the regime was soon abandoned."

Secondly, the reform initiatives that were launched in the military field were implemented in other problematic areas. For example, initiatives to improve tax collection mechanisms in order to improve the financial system of the state were persistently sustained by each ruler. Several measures have been taken in this direction and the system has experienced a transformation in the direction of establishing a modern system of finance. Similarly, the administrative and legal system of the state continuously improved. Finally, we should not forget to mention that the measures taken in the education system continued for a while."

    },
    "explanation": "On November 3, 1839, with the permission of Sultan Abdülmecid I (1839-1861), the Edict of Tanzimat was proclaimed by Mustafa Reşid Pasha. In its most general sense, the Edict of Tanzimat promised four basic reforms. The first of these is that the Edict guarantees the life, honor, and property of the subjects of the ruler. The second is the establishment of a regular taxation system that would replace the tax farming system. The third one is the compulsory military service. The latter signifies the promise of equality before the law for all the subjects, regardless of religion (Zürcher, 2010, p. 84).<br/>The Edict of Tanzimat is the first comprehensive reform initiative for the solution of the “Eastern Question”."

At the time, Atatürk requested that Fethi Bey (former Prime Minister), who was the Paris embassy, establish an opposition party with a liberal program. Atatürk requested from his sister Makbule Hanım and some CHP deputies that they register as members of the new party. Atatürk promised the Liberal Republican Party (Serbest Cumhuriyet Fırkası-SCF) founders that he would be impartial against both parties as the President of the Republic.Hence, Fethi Bey established the party and a small number of deputies, most of whom were very close to Atatürk, registered in the new party. One of the founders of the party, like Fethi Bey, was Ahmet Ağaoğlu, who was recognized with his liberal views. Under the influence of these two founders, SCF adopted a liberal economic program, different from CHP’s approach that followed the statist policies. SCF produced a significant impact in a short time.

Protectors are the backbone of the police. They have a different life order than producers; they identified their assets with the Police. Plato refers to the Myth of Metals (Noble Lie) and he states that each class has an added ore to their soul. The ore of the executive, i.e. the philosopher, is gold. The absence of interference between these classes is a fundamental requirement for the police not to be corrupted or degenerate. Plato, in his book called State, contains very detailed regulations on the social life, education and upbringing of the protectors. The aim is to preserve the internal integrity of the protectors and to prevent the negative change in the Police in this way (Ağaoğulları, 2011, p. 101). In this context, there can be a similarity between the Ottoman military class and the protectors class of Plato."

Immediately after the opening of the Assembly there were small groups operating within the Assembly. The most well-known of these are ‘Tesanut Group’, ‘Istiklal Group’, ‘Müdafaa-i Hukuk Group’, ‘Halk Group’ and ‘Islahat Group’. Deputies who did not take part in this group or did not want to participate in the Assembly first carried out an unorganized activity in the Assembly, and later in July 1922, they established the Second Defence of Rights Association (Second Group). The deputies who did not participate in both groups received the name of the Independent Group as a third group. According to the figures given by Frey, the First Group consisted of 197 members, the Second Group consisted of 118 members and the Independent Group consisted of 122 deputies (Frey, 1965, p. 307). It should be noted that the struggle between these three groups mainly occurred within the Assembly and their reflections to the public was weak."

The main issue after the coup was, who would fill the DP’s vacancy. The two biggest candidates were, Justice Party (Adalet Partisi-AP) under the presidency of Ragıp Gümüşpala and the New Turkey Party under the presidency of Ekrem Alican. Both parties had a liberal program and seeked to fill the gap that the DP had left. The view which appeared in the elections of 15 October 1961 after the May 27 coup, gives the impression that there was a change in the party system at first glance. However, a closer look reveals that there is no fundamental change. The formation of a four-party parliament can be explained by the competition of three parties targeting the DP voters. More importantly, it is seen that the election did not change the table of the period of 1950-60, and the division taking place over the centre-periphery opposition is preserved. CHP received % 36.7of the votes in the 1961 National Assembly; this rate is about 4.5 points below the CHP’s votes in the 1957 elections. In this election, AP received %34.8, Republican Villagers Nation Parti (Cumhuriyetçi Köylü Millet Partisi-CKMP) %14 and New Turkey Parti (Yeni Türkiye PartisiYTP) %13.7 of the votes. The votes of these three parties matching to the DP votes are 62.5%. This table shows that the superiority of the parties seeking the periphery votes continues to increase."

This arrangement was intended to keep small parties, as well as parties deemed ‘out of system’, out of parliament.

    "explanation": "The party system refers to the complex network of relations between and among political parties. This network of relationships varies according to the number of parties, their size, power strategies and electoral system. The most commonly used criteria for classifying party systems is the number of parties competing for power. According to the classical classification of Duverger using the number criterion, there are three types of party systems: (1) One-party system, (2) Two-party system (3) Multi-party system. In the One-party system, a second party is not allowed except for one-party; there is only one- party in the system. One-party systems are divided into two groups. The authoritarian single parties that are not based on an inclusive ideology and the totalitarian One-parties based on a holistic ideology. The second group are communist and fascist parties that are mobilizing society through an ideology, aiming at a new type of human and society that conforms to this ideology. The best example of two-party systems is the US and UK. The two-party system is not the system with only two parties, but a system with two parties which have power potentials competing for political power. Around 90% of the total votes in almost every election is shared between the two parties. The ruling power changes in the hands of these two parties. Duverger states that a simple majority system only supports a two-party system. However, this is not a mechanical relationship. It should be noted that two-party systems work well in countries that have social consensus on the political regime. Multi-party systems are systems with more than two parties competing for power or having the power to influence power. It is divided into two as moderate and excessive multi-party systems. In the moderate multiparty system, parties tend to cluster around two centres. Power changes hands between these alliances that are formed to the right or left of the centre. According to Duverger, two-tiered majority systems support moderate multi-party systems. Excessive multiparty systems are not characterized by a large multiplicity of party numbers, but a multiplicity of political poles and the distance between them. The excessive multiparty system is seen in countries where there is a lack of consensus on the political regime and leads to instability of the government. Duverger believes that pure proportional representation systems support the multi-party system.<br/>The correct answer is D"

    "explanation": "The principle of Kemalist laicism aims at the gradual reduction of the influence of religion on political, social and individual life. Religious control of state affairs is abolished but state control over religion continues. When the state deems it necessary, it uses the religion as a tool for its own legitimacy. But this religion is not a dogmatic religion in the traditional sense; it is a rationalized religion that is compatible with reason and science. One of the aims of taking religion into state control is to prevent religious social opposition which could object to Kemalist power. Kemalism seeks to build a ‘Turkish Islam’ in harmony with nationalism instead of other Islamic interpretations that are widespread in the world. But regulations and practices based on the principle of Kemalist laicism paradoxically set the stage for the development of an Islamist opposition against the regime."

According to this thesis, the Turks are 9,000 years old settled people of Anatolia.

    "explanation": "The currents of thought that emerged in the 19th century in the Ottoman Empire are a product of these historical conditions. These thoughts expressed by the Ottoman intellectuals are basically prescriptions offered to get rid of these bad conditions. In other words, advocated ideas were being designed and implemented to save the Empire, the state. The seeds of many political movements and ideologies that will arise in the Republic of Turkey were laid in this period. In this context, the currents of thought such as Ottomanism, Panislamism, Turkism, Turanism were advocated to return the empire to its former strong days and to fend off existing threats. The common ideal of these currents of thought is to ensure unity of the state. In short, these currents do not have a sociological basis that comes from the social background; political projects designed by statesmen and intellectuals. For the empires, such as the Ottoman Empire, the nationalism movement which had strengthened and spread in the 19th century had serious consequences.<br/>The correct answer is D."

    "explanation": "The Constitution of 1961 is distinctive from the previous constitutions with regard to the separation of powers. While the Constitution of 1924 extensively vested the power in the Assembly, the constitution of 1961 adopted the separation of powers (Özbudun, 2016, p. 40). It established a bicameral assembly consisting of the House of Representatives and the senate of the Republic. On the one hand, to become a member of the house, a person must be at least 30 years old and be literate; on the other hand, to be elected a senator a person must be at least 40 years old and hold a college degree. The executive branch was comprised of the president and the council of the ministers. While the president did not have a political responsibility, the council of the ministers had this kind of responsibility. It was stated that the prime minister had to be a member of the house of the representatives but a person that wasn’t a member of the house would be picked as a minister by the prime minister. The constitution, for the first time, established the constitutional court reviewing the constitutionality of laws passed by the Assembly. The constitution recognized autonomous government agencies such as universities and the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (Türkiye Radyo ve Televizyon Kurumu-TRT). The constitution of 1961 having the features mentioned above regarding functioning of the government made the political system more democratic. It can similarly be said that the constitution held the same democratic perspective with regard to human rights and freedoms."

Mahmud II declared that he would not remove the Janissary corps, but that the janissaries would be present in the new army with a certain amount of troops. When this decision was announced, the janissaries launched a great rebellion. The military units affiliated with the palace who took advantage of the new war technology opened fire on the janissaries. Many janissaries lost their lives in this attempt of rebellion, and the rest of them surrendered or fled. This event, known as Vakayı Hayriye, enabled the Ottoman Empire to get rid of the last traces of the traditional military system (Lewis, 1998, p. 81). A new army was established by Sultan Mahmud II under the name of Asakar-i Mansure-i Muhammediye. Thus, the Ottoman state formed a completely “modern” army system."

That time, Turkey preferred to develop close relations with the Western world. Turkey, for example, became a member of the newly established United Nations. As a result of this preference, Turkey’s transition to multiparty politics was required. For this reason, in 1945, the establishment of new parties was allowed. The most powerful party established during this period was the Democrat Party (Demokrat Parti-DP). The four founders of the party, Celal Bayar, Adnan Menderes, Refik Koraltan and Fuat Köprülü, were members of the Parliament as the Republican People’s Party (Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi-CHP) deputies. In other words, the opposition was born in the CHP itself."

    "explanation": "Although there were a large number of young officers in the coup, their positions were not clear. Because the coup was not achieved in a chain of command, a serious confusion arose on managing the post-coup period. For this reason, the architects of the coup formed a commission which was called the National Unity Committee (Milli Birlik Komitesi). The National Unity Committee consisted of 38 officers and most of them were colonels and lower ranking military officers. The National Unity Committee had the authority to make regulations through which the power was effectively centred in the committee. In a short time, the National Unity Committee banned all political activities within the country, and lots of people were arrested. After the coup, most of the high ranking military officers who had served in the DP government were retired. There were 235 generals and admirals among almost 5,000 military officers who were retired. Only twenty generals remained in the army (Özdağ, 1997, p. 307). This has also ruined the hierarchy in the army. It was mentioned that most of the National Unity Committee members were officers in lower ranks. These officers were ordering their commanders, who were at the higher ranks. Within a short period of time, disagreements emerged within the National Unity Committee. More precisely, conflicting political views of the committee members who had acted together to achieve the coup d’etat emerged. The National Unity Committee composed of officials who were predominantly pro-Republican People’s Party. These officers wanted to act with the CHP leader İsmet İnönü. On the contrary, another group consisting of 14 people had nationalist tendencies. This group which was led by Alparslan Türkeş was against not only the DP but also the CHP. The power struggle between these two groups resulted in the removal of these 14 officers one of whom was Türkeş. They were given foreign missions and, through this way were distanced from the country. Thus, the National Unity Committee could have a more homogeneous character."

Then, Sunay gave Suat Hayri Ürgüplü the duty to establish a new government. However, the president did not approve the list of the Council of Ministers presented by Ürgüplü. Ferit Melen was then assigned as the prime minister. So, in Turkey, a process in which politically neutral governments were at work. But these governments were actually acting under the influence of the soldiers. The soldiers have thought that politicians were applying “populist policies”. According to them, such policies would harm the principles of the Republic and cause “reactionism”."

Some soldiers and civilians planned a coup in cooperation in order to dethrone Sultan Abdulmecid and replace him with Abdulaziz. However, the troops which were affiliated to the palace received the news of this coup attempt before it happened. Afterwards, those who attempted the coup were arrested and tried in Kuleli Quarters. The trial was referred to as Kuleli Incident because the trials took place in Kuleli Quarters."

    },
    "explanation": "One of the most significant changes made in the military field was the abolition of the Janissary corps in 1829. Sultan Mahmud II wanted to make a drastic reform in the military area. The Sultan explained that he would build a new army to be trained and organized in the direction of modern techniques. Mahmud II declared that he would not remove the Janissary corps, but that the janissaries would be present in the new army with a certain amount of troops. When this decision was announced, the janissaries launched a great rebellion. The military units affiliated with the palace who took advantage of the new war technology opened fire on the janissaries. Many janissaries lost their lives in this attempt of rebellion, and the rest of them surrendered or fled. This event, known as Vakayı Hayriye, enabled the Ottoman Empire to get rid of the last traces of the traditional military system (Lewis, 1998, p. 81). A new army was established by Sultan Mahmud II under the name of Asakar-i Mansure-i Muhammediye. Thus, the Ottoman state formed a completely “modern” army system."

    "explanation": "May 27, 1960, Turkey witnessed a coup d’etat which stopped a ten-year period of democracy in the country. In fact, throughout the DP rule, different junta initiatives began to emerge within the military. Some small groups of officers began preparations to overthrow the political power. These had secret meetings among themselves. Some practices in the last period of the DP government encouraged the military officers who were in search of a military intervention. Criticisms about the authoritarian rule of the government led some intellectuals to cooperate with the pro-junta groups in the army. As a result, most colonels and a group of lower-ranking officers of the Armed Forces took action on May 27, 1960 for a coup d’etat. The head of the coup was the former Commander of the Land Forces Cemal Gürsel who had recently retired. By choosing a retired top general as the leader of the junta, the coup plotters were trying to prevent a possible dissolution among themselves. They also aimed at ensuring the support of the military as a whole through this manoeuvre."

    "explanation": "The 1946 elections were held in a short time, not allowing the opposition to organize. Despite this, the DP was quite effective during the process of election campaign. However, these elections were not conducted fairly. The election was held under the supervision of state officials and most of these officers were the members of the CHP. The votes were not explicitly counted; the ballot boxes were abducted in many places. There were very serious suspicions about the manipulation which directly affected the outcome of elections. As a result, the CHP won the elections and continued to rule the country. From now on, however, there was a parliament that composed of two parties. The DP won parliamentary representation and became an influential opposition party."

    "explanation": "Although there were a large number of young officers in the coup, their positions were not clear. Because the coup was not achieved in a chain of command, a serious confusion arose on managing the post-coup period. For this reason, the architects of the coup formed a commission which was called the National Unity Committee (Milli Birlik Komitesi). The National Unity Committee consisted of 38 officers and most of them were colonels and lower ranking military officers. The National Unity Committee had the authority to make regulations through which the power was effectively centred in the committee. In a short time, the National Unity Committee banned all political activities within the country, and lots of people were arrested."

The National Unity Committee composed of officials who were predominantly pro-Republican People’s Party. These officers wanted to act with the CHP leader İsmet İnönü. On the contrary, another group consisting of 14 people had nationalist tendencies. This group which was led by Alparslan Türkeş was against not only the DP but also the CHP. The power struggle between these two groups resulted in the removal of these 14 officers one of whom was Türkeş.

A large number of people were judged and sent to prison with the accusation of their reactionary activities. Some people lost their jobs and professions. On February 28, the military did not make a usual coup. However, politicians were forced to act in the direction of the army’s demands. They changed the elected government and intervened directly into politics without directly taking control of the country. For this reason, the February 28th Process was called the “postmodern coup”."

    "explanation": "In the 1960s, the domestic industry (with the almost total exclusion of foreign consumer goods) captured local markets with high profit margins. A competition-free environment, however, caused misallocation of resources and a maximization of costs in industry. The favorable exchange rates accorded to the investment goods contributed to the capital-intensive industries, which were characterized, by low efficiency and high costs as a result of being domestically oriented (Barkey, 1984). Low industrial efficiency was the result of Turkish development planning, which emphasized high growth rates through a large allocation of investment to import-substituted basic industry and the direction and the use of administrative regulation rather than incentives to ensure the effective functioning of the market."

The Ottoman economy was integrated with the international economic system, however this integration came under the control of the European states before the Tanzimat Reforms in 1839-76 and, thus, it was disadvantageous to the development of Turkey’s productive resources and state revenues. An agricultural economy without land ownership or property rights and the lack of population density in cities also inhibited the development of division of labor and entrepreneurial classes. Ethnicity was a major dividing factor, overshadowing class divisions. The mode of agricultural and industrial production was formed by the state to establish social order and sustainable revenue sources for the military and bureaucratic purposes. In the political economy of the Ottoman Empire, wealth was not necessarily instrumental for gaining political power. This very structure not only failed to adapt to the changes in global trade and industrial markets but also prepared the conditions for the economic collapse."

This sudden change in the CHP ideology was a result of the pressure from the donors of Western aid. DP won the elections in 1950, and Turkey entered into a more liberal economic and political era. This period was marked by capital accumulation in the private sector through government credits originated from foreign aid program. Using the state agencies like the Industrial Development Bank to distribute aid funds increased state patronage and the inefficient use of public funds. The flow of foreign credits as part of the Marshall Program was also used to import agricultural equipment as the general recovery of the world market and the interests of developed countries favored agricultural production and exports in the third world. The private sector started to integrate with international capital as foreign capital flowed in and the economy opened up. Etatism as an authoritarian intervention and control was undermined but this did not mean the abandonment of state investments and intervention. The intervention took the form of clientelism or supporting periphery against the center."

    "explanation": "Military Corporatism vs. Supremacy of Parliament 1960-1983: In this era, socio-economic issues were reduced to technical problems, which could supposedly be solved by rational planning through increasing power of bureaucrats. IMF and the World Bank had also begun to promote import substitution development plans for developing world. So, corporatism, ISI and planned economy triangle was seen as perfect match for the time. Indeed, large industries, in collaboration with foreign capital, continued to benefit from the import-substitution industrialization (ISI) policies of the 1960s by producing durable consumer goods serving domestic demand. However, inter-bourgeoisie conflict and increased trade union activities and socialist movements created political instability and weakened the AP government. The urban unrest of the rising workers’ and students’ movements was the main excuse for the military intervention in March 1971. Throughout the 1970s, Turkey experienced a series of weak coalitions. Low industrial efficiency was the result of Turkish development planning, which emphasized high growth rates through a large allocation of investment to import-substituted basic industry and the direction and the use of administrative regulation rather than incentives to ensure the effective functioning of the market. Towards the end of 1960s, IMF and OECD pressed Turkey to replace protectionism with export promotion strategy in order to solve the growing foreign debt problem."

    "explanation": "Transition to Democracy 1946-1960: The CHP government had already declared the end of restricted wartime measures and the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the state and the private sector. This sudden change in the CHP ideology was a result of the pressure from the donors of Western aid. DP won the elections in 1950, and Turkey entered into a more liberal economic and political era. This period was marked by capital accumulation in the private sector through government credits originated from foreign aid program. Using the state agencies like the Industrial Development Bank to distribute aid funds increased state patronage and the inefficient use of public funds. The flow of foreign credits as part of the Marshall Program was also used to import agricultural equipment as the general recovery of the world market and the interests of developed countries favored agricultural production and exports in the third world. The private sector started to integrate with international capital as foreign capital flowed in and the economy opened up. Etatism as an authoritarian intervention and control was undermined but this did not mean the abandonment of state investments and intervention. The intervention took the form of clientelism or supporting periphery against the center"

    "explanation": "Economic crisis continued with soaring trade deficits, declining currency reserves, high inflation rates, and the shift of capital from productive to non-productive activities. Turkey’s creditors began to plan a rescue operation in 1980. The philosophy behind this operation was associated with Friedmanist (also known as Chicago School) economics which became new panacea for the crisis in the global economy and welfare state in the 70s and a response to rising unpopularity of Keynesian demand-based economics. The minority government of AP, with a standby agreement with IMF, prepared the structural adjustment programs (SAP) known as ‘24 January measures’."

    "explanation": "The Italian, German, and Soviet experiences provided an ideological backup to the etatist wing of CHP, which increasingly advocated more state intervention for rapid industrialization. ‘Rather than the state being the handmaiden of a growing private sector, it was now to seize the “commanding heights” of the economy and bend the private sector to its will’ (Richards and Waterbury, 1996, p. 178). The first Five-Year Economic Plan declared its objective as to invest in areas where private sector could not. One may think that these areas are those which require huge projects like building transportation network such as highways and airports or investing in energy sector like building hydroelectric dams or energy plants. Instead, the aim of the Plan was to produce basic consumption goods at home. Within a few decades, the Turkish state created major industrial enterprises, which produced, almost every kind of commodities such as tobacco, sugar, shoe, textiles, power generations, iron, chemicals, and cement. This indeed narrowed down the sphere of the private sector (Richards and Waterbury, 1996, p. 179). More state banks were founded to plan, finance and invest in different industries. The main side-effect of state-managed industrialization was a growing number of civil servants and public sector workers numbering - excluding military officers - 184,000 in 1945."
