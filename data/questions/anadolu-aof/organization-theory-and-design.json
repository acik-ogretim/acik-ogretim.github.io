    "explanation": "So many authors have presented their ideas to define existing organizations of our lives. There are so many comprehensive definitions that emphasize different specifics of organizations. One of the most accepted, comprehensive and common definitions is the one made by C. I. Barnard, which argues that “organization is a system of consciously coordinated activities of two or more persons.” This very definition by Barnard is used commonly since it encompasses all organizations with different features. This definition increasingly emphasizes the coordination created among individuals. The common side of all organizations is to act in coordinated ways to reach their aims within a certain frame of aims. As two prestigious names in the field of organizational studies, Blau P.M. and Scott W.R. extend the scope of the definition above and utter these words: “The accomplishment of an objective requires collective effort, men set up an organization designed to coordinate the activities of many persons and to furnish incentives for others to join them for this purpose.” There are many other definitions by various other theorists. The definitions above are common ones, which make us prefer them to include in our text. The reason for this much variety about the definitions of organizations is related to the nature of the organizational structure. Organizations are, by their nature, social structures with a highly dynamic system and intense interaction with the surrounding, which leads to treating organizations with different approaches from different academic fields. Not just organizational theorists, but also theoreticians from sociology, economics, psychology, and politics elaborate on organizations to understand and explain them. Organizational theory field has also drawn a lot from other academic disciplines. Researchers that were influenced by different disciplines and trends within organization theory strived for understanding organizations with differenttheoretical backgrounds, which caused various schools of thoughts to emerge.

    "explanation": "One of the common classifications based on organizations aims and functions is the one argued by Blau and Scott. As to their argument, we can separate organizations into four basic types on a very simple level.<br/><strong>Mutual Benefit Organization</strong><br/>Raison d’etre of mutual benefit organizations is to increase their members and thus the benefit they have. Political parties, clubs, and professional organizations are examples of mutual benefit organizations. Individuals tend to participate in these organizations just to make use of their own benefits to the organization. Members of these organizations begin shaping them since their establishment. However, when these organizations reach a certain size and become active in their environments, the potential of members to influence them decreases. This kind of organizations is inclined to conflicts. When the needs of members are not satisfied fully and completely, possible and potential conflicts and problems are among the most encountered problems with this type of organizations. That is why the failure rate of these organizations is quite high.<br/><strong>Business Concerns</strong><br/>Business organizations are established with the aim of economic benefit. The fundamental problem of these organizations is operating efficiency and achievement of maximum gain at minimum cost for further survival and growth in competition with other organization. This type of organization has also a high failure rate. Survival and sustainability are other important problems that business organizations handle. In today’s fast-changing business environment, these organizations suffer the pressure of solving problems and learning in flexible and quicker ways. They are also expected to have innovative processes in a time when the competition is really fierce and global. Facebook, HSBC Bank, IBM, General Motors, Turkish Airlines are examples of these organizations. Even though they all differ from each other in terms of their nature, their goal is to survive and make the profit for growth. The main beneficiaries of commercial organizations are their owners or shareholders.<br/><strong>Service Organizations</strong><br/>Many service organizations are formed not for profit but for offering services to customers in the relevant community. Educational institutions, hospitals, animal protection associations, environment protect associations and various non-profit organizations are examples of these service organizations. These organizations are generally funded by small fees, donations, grants, contributions by members, or government assistance. The main beneficiaries of non-profit organizations are customers and communities. Their main problem is the lack of professional management. A professional way of an organization may be costly for such foundations.<br/><strong>Commonwealth Organizations</strong><br/>These organizations, which are basically for social services, are formed to offer standard services for the majority of the population. The motivator of these organizations is not profit. Police offices, army forces, courts, fire services, and other public institutions are examples of these organizations. The beneficiaries of commonwealth organizations are ordinary people in general.<br/>As also understood from the information given the correct answer is “D”. Political parties, clubs, professional organizations are not examples of business organizations, but mutual benefit organizations. On the other hand, Facebook, HSBC Bank, IBM, General Motors, Turkish Airlines are not example of mutual benefit organizations, but business organizations."

The ideas of these three important organization theorists make up the foundation of today’s organization theories. Following are the still used approaches of these authors. As the first author of these three, F. Taylor is the founder of scientific management. In scientific management, the aim is to produce more through increasing efficiency. As a way to realize this aim, arrangements in the business level make up the main field of activity. The most focused aspect of these studies is business management and organization. In terms of scientific management, etudes of motion and time are given importance to have productivity. Motion etude is used for determining which motions will make the job. The goal is to get the highest result with minimum labor. Time etude is used for determining the standard time of a job. Thus, necessary performance measures can be conducted. In short, this approach is a management theory that tries to explain how to utilize human resource effectively in routine jobs. As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is “A”. Behavioral School following the classical period are known as the micro-organization theory. The contingency theory is the second important approach in modern organization theories and brings a new dimension to the relations of organizations with their environment. The contingency theory that regards the organization as a system argues that only one ever-successful management and organization style is not possible. According to bureaucratic theory, if expanding and growing organizations do not desire to turn out to be inadequate, they must adhere to the ideal bureaucracy structure. The aspects of ideal bureaucracy theory can be summarized as the following six items: A well-defined hierarchy of authority, clear division of work, a system of rules covering the rights and duties of all employees. System approach approach is the one that decides various communication and interaction areas between different units of modern organization and their environment and shows which way to go. The system is an integral structure whose parts communicate and interact with each other."

    "explanation": "Following the classical period, studies of the behavioral school’s current representatives are known as the micro-organization theory. The basic contribution of the behavioral school to the classical management theory is the emphasis on the informal aspects of organizations. While the classical management thought tackles the structural and physical design of organizations, the behavioral school focuses on human relations within organizations. The starting point of the behavioral school is the criticism that the classical school was not humanist and it regarded the human being as a machine, which makes it harder to increase productivity. Effectiveness and productivity, too, are at stake in this period. However, the theorists mentioned try to explain that the human being has also a soul. So, the relations and situations within the organization are seen as variables that influence productivity. The most important studies within this field are Harwood and Hawthorne Experiments. Especially, Hawthorne concludes that productivity can only be increased by the emphasis on the emotional side of the human being and on managerial practices that make an employee feel important. In short, human behavior, human relations, motivation, managerial change, and development are the topics examined in this period, which maintained its importance until the 1960s. As also understood from the information given the correct answer is “C”. “The emphasis on the informal aspects of organizations” and “examining human behavior, human relations, motivation, managerial change, and development” are the basic contributions of the behavioral school to the classical management theory. “Tackling the structural and physical design of organizations” is the contribution of the classical management thought. “taking the relationship of organizations with their environment into consideration” and “considering the organization as an open system” are the benefits of systems approach."

On the contrary, each stage of the value creation process is influenced by the organizational environment. Because of the fact that the other statements are correct, the correct answer is “E”. Inputs may be abstract and concrete things such as end products semi-products money, capital, machine and equipment, human resource and knowledge, which are acquired from organizational environments and used as resources during the value-creation process. This value-creation process will also be influenced by how an organization chooses and acquires the inputs. Quality, amount and compliance of inputs, used in the transformation process, must be paid attention to because inputs as the first stage of value-creation process influence the created value. Procedures followed by organizations to transform inputs to outputs are called transformation process. The last element of the value-creation process is output. The products or services offered by the organization following the transformation process make up the output, which may also be input for another organization. Just as the organization offering output acquires the input from an organization, its output may also be used as an input by another one. In this sense, complex value-creation processes of organizations are influenced by their environments."

Organizational performance is the skill for reaching the organization’s aims using the scarce resources in effective and efficient ways and the consequence of an output or work after a certain period of time. Organizational efficiency means reaching and achieving organizational goals. Organizational effectiveness indicates that how an organization satisfies the demands of various groups. Effectiveness means an evaluation of the usefulness of an organization’s work and how sources are used during this process and also the level of achieving the result that the organization aims to reach. We may summarize these three concepts which are very similar to each other as follows: Efficiency is the criterion for the capability of doing things right during the valuecreation process and effectiveness is the measure of realizing the plans made beforehand, while productivity means producing an output with the least possible input. As also understood from the information given the definitions “Organizational efficiency means reaching and achieving organizational goals.”, “Organizational effectiveness indicates that how an organization satisfies the demands of various groups.” and “Productivity means producing an output with the least possible input.” are correct. The correct answer is “D”. The definitions in the options IV and V are not correct. Efficiency is the criterion for the capability of doing things right during the valuecreation process, while effectiveness is the measure of realizing the plans made beforehand."

    },
    "explanation": "The history of organization theory studies dates back to 100 years, during which basic fields of interest and approaches have been changed. Today, organization theory still preserves its existence with various focal points. While this theory was about to transform in important ways, it took a completely different turn toward the 20th century and had a wide coverage in American business schools and business studies. The discipline of organization theory became one of the important fields of interest for managers who have to design a dynamic-structured organization within an unstable environment. Value chain management requires that managers interconnect their organizing processes with those of suppliers, distributors, and customers; organization theory not only supports the technical aspects of supply chain and business systems integration, but explains their political, social, and cultural aspects as well. Organizations are, by their nature, social structures with a highly dynamic system and intense interaction with the surrounding, which leads to treating organizations with different approaches from different academic fields. Not just organizational theorists, but also theoreticians from sociology, economics, psychology, and politics elaborate on organizations to understand and explain them. The way information flows through the organization affects work processes and outcomes, so knowing organization theory can help IT specialists identify, understand, and serve the organization’s informational needs as they design and promote the use of their information systems. The correct choice is answer E."

The role of a manager in scientific management is to plan and organize the work, while the role of a worker is to fulfill the duties successfully assigned to him/her (Choice D). School of Management Principles contributed to management and organization theory in two important areas. First, this school determined the management functions such as planning, organization, chain of command, coordination, and control that are still valid and important to this day. As a second contribution, this school established 14 principals of management: Division of work, authority, responsibility, discipline, unity of command, unity of direction, subordination of individual interests, remuneration, centralization, scalar chain, order, equity, stability of tenure of personnel, initiative, and esprit de corps (Choice E). Following the classical period, studies of the behavioral school’s current representatives are known as the micro-organization theory. The basic contribution of the behavioral school to the classical management theory is the emphasis on the informal aspects of organizations.

Whereas, it was observed that the electronic manufacturers in the same research preferred completely different organizational design. Learning and creativity become vital when organizations face with turbulent environments. In this case, old-fashioned ways of organizing business may restrict learning, creativity and innovation. Turbulent environment requires natural or organic system design according to Burns and Stalker. Organizational structure should enable learning and creativity. Applying written rules, guidelines and instructions to employees is not a good idea in this respect. Employees should feel themselves free and powerful to become innovative and creative. Horizontal structures, which aim at enabling information share among units and employees, have to be adopted to increase learning capacity of these organizations. Management has to be tolerant towards faults and mistakes of employees to encourage them to learn. It may not be sufficient only to make internal adjustments for innovation and creativity. Organizations need to interact with the other organizations in their environment to transfer knowledge and new ideas. This requires the development of good relations and search for some opportunities to have collaboration with the others.

    },
    "explanation": "Social network theory emphasizes that organizations need social support from the important actors in their environment just as an individual or a group of people. Having social ties with the key decision makers and the other organizations can enable flow of resources into an organization. Famous French sociologist Pierre Bordieu and other network researchers define <strong><em>social capital </em></strong>as network relations of an actor that can provide benefits. Organizations, which have broad and influential social networks, can have a significant competitive advantage over others that are having few social connections. If this assumption is valid in business life, organizations should spend their efforts to increase quantity and quality of their social connections. Their intention to form organizational social capital may lead to emergence of complex inter-organizational networks. It can be vitally important for a manager to examine and analyze these networks in the external environment. Organizations can form a network of relations by hiring individuals who can provide the required social connections, collaborating with other organizations or promoting employees who have powerful social networks to the critical positions - strategic level. In the given example, too, this kind of an advatage is described. Therefore, choice (d) is the correct answer."

Second, innovators gather new ideas by observing the environment as if they were anthropologists. They get out of their offices to watch the world around them-especially customers, products, services, and processes-to activate unique ways of doing things. Third, innovators surpass at networking, talking with people to find-or actuate a new way to solve-perplexing problems. They regularly communicate with people who do not look, act, or (most importantly) think as they do. Instead of networking simply to gain resources, they interact with diverse people to get new ideas. Finally, innovators generate insights by invariably experimenting. They test new experiences wherever they go. They disassemble products or processes to see how things work-and how to improve them."

      "D": "Culture of “play”",
      "E": "Autonomous actions of employees"
    },
    "explanation": "As innovators are engaged in the four behaviors, it is crucial to search broadly. One source of insight is abstract concepts or findings derived from basic research (science). Basic research is conducted to discover new knowledge and is often published in academic journals. The main aim of basic science is enhancing the fundamental understanding of nature, without any commercial application or benefit in mind. In the end, however, basic research is often transformed into applied research with commercial applications. Secondly, individuals are likely to be creative in their work, especially in organizations that further a culture of “play”. Finally, insight can also emerge through autonomous actions, which are strategic initiatives undertaken by lower-level employees on their own will and often in response to unexpected situations. To be successful, top-level managers need to support autonomous actions that they believe fit with the organization’s vision and mission. The insight could be finding a problem that others have missed or perhaps uncovering a potential new solution to a well-understood problem. Four behaviors trigger generating insights: questioning, observing, networking, and experimenting. First, innovators bring forth insights through questioning, constantly challenging the status quo with “why” and “why not” questions to turn things upside-down. They often ask “what if” questions to envision a different future. Questioning gives you the fuel to power new associations and insights. Second, innovators gather new ideas by observing the environment as if they were anthropologists. Third, innovators surpass at networking, talking with people to find-or actuate a new way to solve-perplexing problems. Finally, innovators generate insights by invariably experimenting. They test new experiences wherever they go. They disassemble products or processes to see how things work-and how to improve them. The correct answer is Choice C."

Four behaviors trigger generating insights: questioning, observing, networking, and experimenting. The elaboration of the idea takes place at the development stage. After identifying a customer problem worth solving, innovators search broadly for a variety of solutions and then use a series of prototypes. A prototype is a full-scale working model that is being tested for design, function, and reliability. Implementation means the widespread acceptance of the innovation.

Organizations arrange boards, policies and detailed procedures for decisions to be taken in such repetitive situations. This type of solution eliminates a very time-consuming process of identifying and evaluating alternatives and making new decisions. Managers, thus, have the opportunity to devote their time to solving more complex problems.

There is a need for more comprehensive information to make such decisions. Greater coordination between departments of the organization is expected. There is also greater cooperation between departments. It is often impossible to know whether such decisions are correct.

There is a need for more comprehensive information to make such decisions. Greater coordination between departments of the organization is expected. There is also greater cooperation between departments. It is often impossible to know whether such decisions are correct. Managers make such decisions on the basis of their past experience and predictions.

If the decisionmaker realizes that his/her past decision is mistaken, he/she increasingly believes that living through this is inevitable due to hindsight bias. Meanwhile, hindsight bias are the reflections of overconfidence, which causes decision-maker to re-build the past and matches his/her current knowledge."

    "explanation": "What was the reason behind the rise of organizational culture as a concept for understanding organizations? Of course, it was not coincidental. Many social, field and individual-level developments triggered the increase of awareness in the 90s. These factors are explained below:5 • Individualism and alienation: By the end of 1970s modern societies witnessed widespread diffusion of individualism that alienated people from the society. Lonely people searching for an identity celebrated organizational culture as a haven. Organizational culture allowed people to answer aching questions for raison d’etre! “Who am I, what is my reason for being in this world? what this organization stands for?” are all examples of questions asked and generally found an explanation within the concept of organizational culture. • Technically advanced production and the rise ofservice industry: Production process was upgraded to an advanced level in which automation became widespread. Moreover, the volume of service industry gradually surpassed goods production in many developed countries.Thus,employees had to be more customer-focused and technically qualified. Consequently, skillful and welltrained employees preferred independent working conditions. Organizational culture, as a way of controlling employee behavior, allows members to use their judgment, and act morefreely within defined organizational norms. Once members of the organizations cultivated with organizational values, close supervision will be redundant.• Machine bureaucracy gradually became less useful in managing people: Scientific management was the paradigm relevant to 1960s and 1970s. During 1980s validity of scientific management as the only paradigm for managing people started to be scrutinized. The effectiveness of objective and mathematical management techniques like time-and-motion studies was challenged. This movement led scholars focusing on the human aspect of management, or in other words, “soft” aspects of organizations. • Innovative production techniques: Mass production techniques increase the level of efficiency. But these techniques usually decrease the overall flexibility of the organization. To balance the level of efficiency with the degree of flexibility, organizations should employ people who have a sense of active belonging and commitment. Organizational culture is providing a cognitiveschemethroughwhich members can agree upon collective values, and thus elevates the level of organizational commitment. • Japanese miracle: After the devastation experienced by Japan following the 2nd World War, Japan’s reborn as an economic power found to be related to the Japanese management style. Globalization which is generally equated with getting rid of economic, political, cultural, and technological barriers led to an increase in awareness and curiosity in the global west for the east. It was self-evident that Japanese miracle was mostly related to the Japanese cultural value system and its reflections within Japanese organizations. Other countries also tried to understand and encapsulate these reflections for themselves, and hence the interest in the cultural aspect of organizations tend to strengthen."

    "explanation": "Although culture has become one of the most popular concepts of management and organization curriculum by the 1980’s, studies that can be linked to organizational culture has much deeper historical roots. For example, you may recall Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856 - 1915) from your business management course as the father of scientific management. Taylor published e Principles of Scientific Management in 1911 through which he heralded the introduction of scientific principles into work. But a closer look at Taylor’s scientific management principles will reveal cultural aspects of a system through which he standardizes work and eventually the process leads to the minimization of employees’ resistance. Instead of workers’ values, the introduction of scientific management nurtured values of managers. Another well-known study which shapes the way how organizations function is the famous Hawthorne Studies, led by Harvard Business School professor Elton Mayo at Western Electric Hawthorne Works Plant between 1924 - 1933. Based on Hawthorne Studies’ outcome Mayo’s protégé Fritz Rothlisberger and his colleague William John Dickson reports that social factors rather than physical factors are found to be much more important for increasing the level efficiency.

As we touched upon, top managers and founders have a substantial influence on organizational culture. In addition to these top figures, human resources employed by the organization also has an enduring effect on organizational culture. All participating organizational members interactively shape organizational culture, so it should be viewed as the fundamental aspect of the culture itself. Employees are bound to the organization with a labor contract, but contemporary organizations require one to add more than what is written in these contracts. Requirements of modern business life can only be fulfilled by employees who can develop <em>organizational citizenship behavior</em>. This situation leads us to another type of contract called psychological contract. To create strong ties with employees, organizations should focus on psychological contract. Typically, this type of bonds can only be created within strong organizational cultures.Organizations demand more, and in turn, employees request more. For example, today employees are looking for fun at work, flexible working hours, empowerment, slack time for innovation. Suitable organizational cultures can only fulfill these requests.

    },
    "explanation": "What was the reason behind the rise of organizational culture as a concept for understanding organizations? Of course, it was not coincidental. Many social, field and individual-level developments triggered the increase of awareness in the 90s. These factors are explained below:5 • Individualism and alienation: By the end of 1970s modern societies witnessed widespread diffusion of individualism that alienated people from the society. Lonely people searching for an identity celebrated organizational culture as a haven. Organizational culture allowed people to answer aching questions for raison d’etre! “Who am I, what is my reason for being in this world? what this organization stands for?” are all examples of questions asked and generally found an explanation within the concept of organizational culture. • Technically advanced production and the rise ofservice industry: Production process was upgraded to an advanced level in which automation became widespread. Moreover, the volume of service industry gradually surpassed goods production in many developed countries.Thus,employees had to be more customer-focused and technically qualified. Consequently, skillful and welltrained employees preferred independent working conditions. Organizational culture, as a way of controlling employee behavior, allows members to use their judgment, and act morefreely within defined organizational norms. Once members of the organizations cultivated with organizational values, close supervision will be redundant.<br/>Machine bureaucracy gradually became less useful in managing people: Scientific management was the paradigm relevant to 1960s and 1970s. During 1980s validity of scientific management as the only paradigm for managing people started to be scrutinized. The effectiveness of objective and mathematical management techniques like time-and-motion studies was challenged. This movement led scholars focusing on the human aspect of management, or in other words, “soft” aspects of organizations. • Innovative production techniques: Mass production techniques increase the level of efficiency. But these techniques usually decrease the overall flexibility of the organization. To balance the level of efficiency with the degree of flexibility, organizations should employ people who have a sense of active belonging and commitment. Organizational culture is providing a cognitiveschemethroughwhich members can agree upon collective values, and thus elevates the level of organizational commitment. • Japanese miracle: After the devastation experienced by Japan following the 2nd World War, Japan’s reborn as an economic power found to be related to the Japanese management style. Globalization which is generally equated with getting rid of economic, political, cultural, and technological barriers led to an increase in awareness and curiosity in the global west for the east. It was self-evident that Japanese miracle was mostly related to the Japanese cultural value system and its reflections within Japanese organizations. Other countries also tried to understand and encapsulate these reflections for themselves, and hence the interest in the cultural aspect of organizations tend to strengthen."
