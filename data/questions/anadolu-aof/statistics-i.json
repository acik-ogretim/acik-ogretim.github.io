The question about climate change, with possible responses “natural”, “manmade” or “don’t know/can’t answer” is a nominal categorical variable, as is the variable “country” - there is no ordering in the categories of these variables.

There is a subtle difference between interval-scale and ratio-scale continuous data, which is worth mentioning here. Age is an interval-scale variable: to compare two children of ages 10 and 12, we would compute the interval difference, i.e. 2 years. We would not say the 12-year old is 20% older than the 10-year old. But comparing prices or incomes, for example, we would tend to compute percentage differences, making them ratio-scale variables. A good example is the inflation rate, comparing the prices of a basket of products over time, not as a difference but as a percentage.

    "explanation": "A study that involves Statistics will clearly involve a process of data collection. But there are differences in study objectives which are important to recognize. The main distinguishing factor is whether the study aims to find some evidence of a result or whether it aims to find causes of a result. Medical research is a good context to understand these differences - Statistics in medical research is often called Biostatistics.\n<br/>It is true that many benefits have been detected of taking a low-dosage of aspirin every day. For example, it has been observed that people who take aspirin regularly (less than 300 mg per day) generally have less health problems such as heart attacks, strokes and cancers. The keyword is “observed”: in a community health study involving thousands of people there will be many that take aspirin regularly for problems such as back pain or headaches. For those people it could be observed that they have less chronic diseases compared to people who don’t take aspirin. This is evidence of a difference, but it does not prove that aspirin is the actual cause of the improved health. People who do not take aspirin daily might be poorer and neglect taking medication, and they suffer from more chronic diseases than people with a higher income, so the real difference is socio-economic. From such an observational study it is not possible to conclude a causal effect, it just gives some tentative evidence of a possible relationship between the treatment and the outcome.\n<br/>In order to be able to prove that aspirin is the cause of the improvement in health, an experiment needs to be conducted where conditions are controlled between those taking aspirin and those not taking it. Such an experiment might be designed as follows, restricted to men, for example, since the effects are suspected to be different for men and women. Suppose we take a large group of men in the age group 60- 70 years of age that have no history of chronic disease. We divide them into two groups so that the groups are “balanced” in terms of known factors such as age, social class, and so on (we don’t want one group to have older men than the other). By the way, this “dividing into two groups” is not a trivial matter, but that is a subject for later in this course. Assuming the two groups are comparable, then one group is given the daily low dose of aspirin and the other not, and the groups are followed up for a five-year period and then compared for the incidence of health problems that develop during this time. If the group taking aspirin has less health problems, this would indicate a beneficial effect caused by the aspirin.\n<br/>This type of experiment on people has all sorts of problems, but it is really leading to a conclusion about whether aspirin is the real cause of differences between the two groups. There is the ethical problem of not giving the daily aspirin, which has suspected benefits, to a large group of people. There is also the problem that one group knows it is taking the medication and might change their lifestyle to favour a good outcome by living more healthily. This effect can be eliminated by not telling either group what they are getting and giving the non-aspirin group a so-called placebo, which is medication in the form of an aspirin, so both groups think they are getting the medication.\n<br/>As also understood from the information given, “A study which aims to find some evidence of a result” is an example of observational studies, so the correct answer is only I. “A study which aims to find causes of a result”, “A study in which the groups are “balanced” in terms of known factors” and “A study conducted where conditions are controlled” are the examples of experimental studies."

Experiment is a type of study designed specifically to answer the question of whether there is a <strong>causal relationship</strong> between at least two variables. In other words, whether changes in an independent variable (science course design: with field trip or without field trip) cause a change in a dependent variable (science academic achievement). Experiments have two fundamental features. The first is that the researchers <strong>manipulate , or systematically vary, or control</strong> the level of the independent variable."

However, researchers cannot control all the variables having effects on the dependent variable. In this case, randomization techniques are applied to balance out the influence of any uncontrolled variable that might affect the variable of interest. Suppose we want to investigate the effects of exercise on cold by using an experimental design. For this purpose, we obtain a group of individuals who are the volunteers to participate the study. Then, we randomly assign the participants to the treatment (exercise) and control (no exercise) groups. After a lapse of time, we record the number of colds for each individual from the two experimental groups."

The observer or the instrument to be used for data gathering must be able to record the events correctly. For example, human observers must get through training about the study and the data to be collected and so that different observers will record the same events in the same manner.<br/>2.

Sampling methods must be used to achieve a representative sampling. Otherwise, the sampling does not represent the targeted population and the results yield biased or inaccurate information.\n Error in population specification occurs when the researcher determines an inappropriate population from which to collect data.\n Error in measurement can be described as any discrepancy between the actual result obtained and the correct result that would be provided by an ideal procedure. From a statistical point of view any observation is composed of the true value plus some random error value. However, all error is not random. The error component of any observation can be divided into two subcomponents, random error and systematic error.<br/>Random errors are caused by unknown and unpredictable factors that randomly affect measurement of the variable across the sample. For example, a school teacher conducted a particular survey on the students to measure their performances. Some students may be feeling in a good mood and others may be depressed. This may artificially deflate performance scores of the depressed students. Random error does not have any consistent effects across the entire sample. Instead, it affects observed scores up or down randomly. Random error adds variability to the data and it is sometimes called noise.<br/>Systematic errors are reproducible inaccuracies that shift measurements from their true value by the same amount and consistently in the same direction. This type error arises from problematic, poor calibrated or incorrectly used equipment. For example, an industrial scale showed heavier weights than it should be for a particular product because it was not calibrated properly and thereby provided incorrect measurements."

    "explanation": "Histogram is a graph that is very similar to a bar chart except that bar charts are drawn for qualitative data but histograms are drawn for continuous data. In order to draw the histogram of the data, we usually need to have a large sample. If you remember from previous chapters, the data was classified in to grouped frequency distributions, basically you can think histograms as bar plots of grouped frequency distributions. If you create a grouped frequency distribution of the data, you can easily create the histogram of the same data. Similarly, by looking at a histogram one may easily create the grouped frequency distribution of the data. In bar charts the columns/bars are separated from each other by a convenient distance whereas in histogram the columns/bars are adjacent to each other."

    "explanation": "Normal distribution provides basis for the statistical inference. Normal distribution is a symmetric distribution where the random variable values are uniformly scattered around the mean. Population mean, μ and standard deviation σ parameters determine the shape of the normal distribution function. Uniform distribution is different than normal distribution."

    "explanation": "First property assures that probability density function of random variable x obtain the non-negative values at all times. From the shape of the probability density function curve it’s obvious that pdf, f (x) decreases as the random variable value goes away from the mean, μ. Likewise, probability density function f (x) increases as the random variable value gets closer to the mean, μ. Second property identifies that the area under the probability density function f (x) always equivalent to 1 in the definition interval of the random variable X. Third property suggests that normal distribution curve has a similar shape on both sides of the mean x=μ. That property also proposes the fact that, P (X &lt; μ ) = P (X &gt; μ ) =0.5. Fourth property indicates that the tails of the probability function goes to infinity and at no time crosses or touches the x axis."

    "explanation": "Exponential distribution is another most significant and extensively used continuous probability distribution. Exponential random variable is frequently used to model the time interval between two events. Exponential random variable is defined with a parameter λ and it’s represented as X~Exponential (λ). In that sense the exponential random variable X defines the time interval between two consecutive events of a Poisson process with a mean of µ = λ. Here λ parameter defines the number of events is a certain time period. Therefore, it’s essential to use consistent time units in the determination of probabilities, mean and variance with the exponential random variable X. The mean (µ) and variance (σ2) for exponential random variable X~Exponential (λ) with parameter λ can be calculated from the following formulas,<br/>E(x) = µ = 1/λ<br/>V (x) =σ2 = 1/λ2\n Hence from above given formulas it’s clear that the mean and the standard deviation of the exponential distribution are equal."
