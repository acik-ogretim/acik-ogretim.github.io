In this regard, cosmopolitanism represents a spirited challenge to more traditional views that focus on age-old attachments of people to a place, customs, and culture.

    "explanation": "If negotiations are hard to initiate because of strong emotions the parties have or because negotiations have started but reached an impasse for any reason, the parties may need some assistance from an external party, a third party, in other words. The most common and well-known type of third-party intervention in situations of conflict is mediation. International and social conflicts alike are often the subject of mediation. Mediation differs from other types of third-party intervention in that it is not based on the direct use of force. It aims to bring the conflict to a settlement acceptable to both sides voluntarily. Mediation is also a political process with no advance commitment from the parties to accept the mediator’s ideas of formulas. In this regard, it differs from arbitration that employs judicial procedure and issues a verdict that the parties have committed themselves beforehand to accept. Mediation can be best thought of as a dialogue or negotiation with the involvement of a third-party. Mediation, therefore, is an extension of the negotiation process, extending the bargaining into a new format, and using a mediator who can contribute new variables and dynamics to the interaction of disputants."

For example, in most liberal democracies, minority rights are strictly protected by law, different ethnic groups have a space to exercise their own group identities, and social problems can find democratic channels to express themselves. Equally or more important, the distribution of political power can be (re-) shaped through political elections.

      "E": "They often occur in resource-rich countries due to the easy exploitation of these resources."
    },
    "explanation": "One of the most typical contemporary civil wars is coined as resource wars, and they result from the power dynamics over the control, use and exploitation of natural resources such as oil, timber, minerals, and water. Such resource wars have shown an increasing trend so far and this trajectory will likely be the case in the future since the demand for natural resources have been getting greater than before in considerable proportions. There are many communities across the world that are affected by the scarcity of critical natural resources. For example, the lack of water is likely to be one of the most common civil war causes in the future. However, it is not only the lack of resources that cause conflicts, but also their abundance, which is known as ‘resource curse’. There are many countries in the world that have been torn apart by armed conflict because they have plenty of natural resources such as mines, oil, gas, and timber. This may seem to be paradoxical but the legal and illegal resource exploitation help trigger civil wars and exacerbate them because they provide easily accessible financial resources for the continuation of civil wars (Renner, 2002; Le Billion, 2008; Zambonis, 2004). In relation to the close correlation between natural resources and armed conflict, the following main trends have been observed: Civil wars depend on natural resource export and/or exploitation rather than the abundance of natural resources itself as a factor that is connected to civil war."

Grievance based motivations emphasise deprivation with respect to material resources, socio-economic status, and political participation (Gurr, 2000). The South African land ownership dispute and resulting abolition of Apartheid stems from the grievance of locals being deprived ownership of the land they lived on."

    "explanation": "Although many cultural identities are inherited, they are sometimes created, modified, or reconstructed. A representative example of this is the influence of colonialism on the development of cultural identities in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and elsewhere. For instance, the arbitrary boundaries drawn by Europeans in their quest to establish states in Africa and Asia divided once cohesive communities, and in some cases brought together groups who had long been in competition or conflict. Moreover, colonial administrations in many countries utilised the policy of ‘divide and rule’, which led to fierce intertribal rivalries. As the colonial masters withdrew after independence, the struggle for power that ensued transformed these inter-tribal rivalries into bitter and protracted armed conflicts in some regions. This was particularly the case in Africa, where a number of groups are still engaged in armed conflicts over political and economic resources (Rupesinghe, 1998)."

    "explanation": "There has been extensive research on the causality or correlation between a number of social and economic issues and military conflicts. If cultural factors draw clear distinctions between social groups, socio-economic factors serve to promote the tensions and competition between them. More specifically, such research focuses on the political and economic interests of the actors who engage in conflict. The type of political system in a country can strongly affect both the possibility of war breaking out and its progress. Thus, the political system is a socioeconomic factor influencing violent conflict."

However, an increasing number of studies apply systematic analysis on psychological violence (Krippner and McIntyre, 2003; Martz, 2010). In this case, the oppression and suppression of critical views in the media by the state is a form of psychological violence."

    "explanation": "Cultural heritage, such as language, religion, ethnicity and nationality, can be an important source of the conflict between individuals and groups. Some scholars have posited that cultural factors are more likely to cause violent conflict than other factors since actors are less likely to compromise on such issues (Huntington, 1993). Many previous examples of violent conflict demonstrate that people fight to maintain their own cultural identity <br/>or remove others, and various discussions in peace studies point to the significant roles played by the following three factors - namely ethnicity, religion, and legacies of colonialism- in the emergence and development of a violent conflict. In particular, ethnicity and religion have been argued to be the two most outstanding sources of contemporary armed conflicts."

      "E": "They eliminate the need for social reforms"
    },
    "explanation": "T‍he academic community is largely in agreement on the role that poor economic conditions play as a long-term source of violent conflicts. If a society does not offer adequate opportunities for the fulfilment of people’s needs, the possibility of violence increases. Moreover, the competition between social groups becomes more intense in cases where resources are limited, and violent conflict is therefore more likely to erupt. Socio-economic inequality sometimes plays a bigger role than poverty per se in initiating violent conflicts. Inequalities in economic wealth or political power usually produce an exclusive social hierarchy that heightens social tensions. Economic growth is normally uneven, increasing the interests of some groups while subjecting others to new forms of poverty. If the disadvantaged groups’ attempts to redress the social disparity continually fail, their anger and resentment is likely to increase tensions and raise the likelihood of violence. The dominant groups are also tempted to use violence to maintain their privilege against “the challenges posed by endemic economic crises, foreign competition, and workers’ demands”. T‍he type of political system in a country can strongly affect both the possibility of war breaking out and its progress. Societies in which people are free to express their grievances and seek their redress through peaceful means (e.g. via dialogue or political deliberation) are less likely to experience violent conflict than other types of societies. The academic discourse on the role of the political system in preventing violent conflicts in increased with the emergence of Democratic Peace Theory, which argues that “democratic states almost never go to war with each other”"

      "E": "Balance in climate conditions"
    },
    "explanation": "In addition to the cultural and socioeconomic sources of conflict, there are two contemporary issues that have attracted particular academic attention in recent times: the proliferation of small arms and environmental degradation.\n <strong>Proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons </strong>\n The growth in the global arms trade has made small arms and light weapons readily available to those factions able to afford them. It is estimated that there are half a billion small arms currently in circulation worldwide, causing the death of approximately half a million people annually. Unlike nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, nation states and the international community have encountered serious challenges in controlling and preventing the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. The widespread availability of small arms continues to pose a major threat to human security and has been implicated as a factor in starting and prolonging a large number of violent conflicts since “war is possible as soon as weapons are available with which to fight it” (Smith, 2004: 5). 39\n <strong>Environmental Degradation </strong>\n Environmental degradation in many cases causes a rapid reduction in three types of renewable resources - water, forests and fertile soil - and the scarcity of these resources initiates or propels military conflicts. For instance, the lack of water due to chronic drought frequently causes serious inter-clan conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa. When the problem of scarcity is combined with the issue of uneven distribution, the risk of violence becomes much higher. Thus, as global climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of such formidable natural disasters, the conflicts caused/catalysed by environmental degradation are becoming a central issue in peace and conflict studies."

    },
    "explanation": "<strong>Physical and Psychological Violence </strong>\n Whether a form of violence affects the body or mind is a fundamental criterion for categorising the type of violence. <em>Physical violence </em>refers to violence that harms the human body or physical objects. Galtung (1969: 169) suggests that physical violence can be categorised into two groups: biological violence and physical violence that constrains human movements (e.g. imprisonment). The effects of physical violence on human behaviour are clearly evident and have been well explored in previous peace studies (in fact, most previous academic discussion on the impact of warfare focus on this aspect). By contrast, psychological <em>violence </em>includes the types of action that might affect human psychology, including “lies, brainwashing, indoctrination of various kinds, threats, etc” (Galtung, 1969: 19), and the impact of psychological violence is not always easily identifiable. However, an increasing number of studies apply systematic analysis on psychological violence (Krippner and McIntyre, 2003; Martz, 2010).\n <strong>Intended Violence and Unintended Violence </strong>\n In traditional models of moral judgement, including Judaeo-Christian ethics and Roman jurisprudence, the ‘intention’ or ‘purpose’ of a person’s behaviour is considered more important than the consequences of their behaviour. As a result, many previous studies have tended to neglect the impact of <em>unintended violence</em>, even though unintended violence in human society may have devastating effects on human well-being. One example is structural violence, which has a serious effect on people’s lives but may not reflect the intention of a certain person or a group to harm the people. Another is environmental pollution, in which case, although the effects may be unintentional, careless policies and practices may have serious consequences.\n <strong>Manifest Violence and Latent Violence</strong>\n While <em>manifest violence </em>refers to forms of violence that are observable, <em>latent violence </em>denotes potential violence that may not yet be apparent. For instance, regarding the British and French colonialism in Sub-Saharan Africa, although manifest violence of the colonialist powers targeted a relatively small number of people, the fear of African populations of potential violence enabled the UK and France to control the countries. As with unintended violence, some academic studies have failed to recognise the potential impact of latent violence. As Galtung argues, it is important to include this form of violence in an analytical framework because as the level of potential violence increases, social tension and instability intensify (Galtung, 1969: 173). In fact, the inclusion of latent violence in the equation significantly expands the scope of peacebuilding operations to include efforts to address the ‘invisible’ dimensions of war-affected societies."

As indicated with these three layers of questions, the tool aims to analyse what different parties to a conflict are ‘saying’. In this way, it would be possible to move beyond the parties’ public position which could be quite different than each party’s real interests and needs. Having done such an analysis, the expectation would be to find the common ground between the parties in order to explore opportunities for further discussions and dialogue.

Having identified the unstable situation such as a particular conflict and placed in the middle of an inverted triangle standing on one point. The next stage of the exercise would involve the identification of ‘supporting pillars’ on both sides of the triangle. For example, the conflict between the parties might be supported by such pillars as prejudices, corruption, unjust laws, regional interferences, historical grievances, etc. Next, the exercise would consider how each pillar could be weakened or completely removed, and what actions and interventions this would require. It would also be possible to explore how these forces could be turned into positive ones with an outlook of what roles that the parties could play in such a process."

Seeking to maximize power and power capabilities-for example becoming regionally dominant can lead to wars among states.</li><br/><li> The third is Kapitalpolitik reasons. Economic issues, such oil prices, pipelines, transportation routes, and relations between wealthy and poor countries, can play central roles in the emergence of interstate armed conflicts.</li><br/><li>The fourth category is Idealpolitik reasons.

The central government conducted peace talks<br/>to reach an agreement for decades; nevertheless, each time an agreement was reached, one of the sides found an excuse and broke the process. In a nutshell, conflict settlement aims to end violent conflict and direct the parties towards peace by settling a dialogue between them and along with providing a suitable<br/>environment."

Peacekeeping traditionally refers to the deployment of lightly-armed military forces between the armed forces of belligerents in order to monitor a ceasefire or patrol a buffer zone.

The restoration of peace could be achieved through the transformation of the context in which the conflict takes place, particularly through regional or systemic changes. As a result, the new and changed environment makes the conflict less meaningful and easy to transform to a peaceful coexistence. In this respect, conflict transformation could be attained through the conversion of opposing actors. For instance, an alteration in the number of actors carries the conflict from a zero-sum game to a distinct nature. Additionally, an explicit shift from extremism to more moderate in the perspectives of actors and leaders of the confronting sides also might render transformation."

    "explanation": "Assimilation policy expects the extermination of minority identities, melting their members into the accepted state identity. Aiming to enforce the acceptance of the preferred identity, the assimilationist state deploys coercive means when<br/>there is resistance to the hegemonic policies. A softer version of assimilation policy is integration which tolerates different identities but allows them only in the private lives of individuals, however, expecting every citizen to act in accordance<br/>with the state identity in public life. With this policy, ethnic or native tongue speakers are allowed to practice these languages in the private space. Nonetheless, the education system is built upon the official language of the state, which is also expected to be used in public life. This policy, ideally, facilitates the assimilation of minorities in the long-run and voluntarily, where harsher assimilation policy aims short-term outcomes and does it through force<br/>(Erkem Gulboy, 2015: 60). In the cases in which strong minority identities persist, assimilation policies are challenging to succeed; they will typically result in conflict or prompts the minority to leave the country for a more liberal state where they may enjoy their culture, venturing to be diasporas away from their home."

    "explanation": "The first and most essential element of ripeness theory is a mutually hurting stalemate. It is mostly based on cost-benefit analysis. When conflicting parties calculate the cost and benefit of a conflict, the cost should be perceived as a catastrophe. The cost of war increases while the benefit of victory is reduced. That means the benefits of negotiations outweigh the losses of further fighting. The cost could be perceived as a loss of human lives, economic or military resources, or time.

It emerges from a perception that the conflict is dysfunctional or when pressure is applied by a third party.In this regard, Pruitt (2005a:7) highlights the role of third parties in motivating actors to stop fighting.The second psychological variable of readiness theory is optimism. Optimism refers to a sense of the possibility of moving to a mutually acceptable<br/>agreement. Pruitt (2007:1529) says that motivation by itself is not enough to involve a negotiation; parties need optimism about the results of the peace talks.According to Pruitt (2007), parties have to lower their aspirations to increase optimism.

      "E": "Base agreements solely on the strongest party’s demands"
    },
    "explanation": "Fisher et al. (2016) offer a third way of negotiation that involves positional and integrative bargaining strategies and can be adapted to all negotiation processes. It has four essential points:<br/>• People: “Separate the people from the problem.” Negotiating parties should separate the people from the problem. People should see each other as people working to solve the same problem.<br/>• Interests: “Focus on interests, not positions.” Position limits to reach the benefit of negotiation. In this regard, participants should focus on interests while ignoring positions.<br/>• Options: “Generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do.” It is challenging to create new ideas and solutions under pressure. Focusing on a single solution prevents the emergence of<br/>alternative thought. Parties should look for mutually alternative solutions before an agreement.<br/>• Criteria: “Insist the result be based on some objective standard.” In the traditional method, while one side accepts compromise, the other may get everything it wants.

    "explanation": "In the first decade of the 21st century, the UN has further expanded its integrated approach and strengthened its post-conflict peacebuilding architecture. The Report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations (UN, 2000:6-8), known as the “Brahimi Report”, recommended various peacebuilding tools and strategies, including:<br/>• the adoption of quick impact projects (QIPs), <br/>• the creation of a fund for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR), <br/>• the adoption of a “doctrinal shift” away from international civilian policing to “rule of law teams” in complex peace operations, <br/>• regularized funding for the Electoral Affairs Division.<br/>The Brahimi Report recommended practical peacebuilding tools such as <strong>quick impact projects</strong>, <strong>a DDR fund</strong>, and a <strong>shift toward rule of law teams</strong>, marking a significant evolution in the UN’s integrated approach."

    },
    "explanation": "The complexities of post-conflict reconstruction have highlighted the significance of structural issues and essential measures that aim to promote consolidated peace and sustainable development in war-torn countries. Despite its shortcomings, postconflict peacebuilding and reconstruction have continued to develop in an expanding context, which included the efforts at micro and macro levels such as altering structural contradictions, improving relations of conflicting parties, and transforming individual attitudes and behavior (Schmelzle and Fischer, 2009). Peacebuilding encompasses processes ranging from microlevel changes in the perception and behavior of individuals affected by conflict to macro-level institutional changes that address the structural causes of conflict (Chimni, 2003; Lilly, 2004).<br/>The question invites students to <strong>synthesize</strong> key ideas from the passage(on the page,129): peacebuilding is most effective when it includes <strong>both individual-level (micro)</strong> and <strong>structural-level (macro)</strong> approaches."

    },
    "explanation": "It is possible to categorize the main themes that are emphasized under the phases of the post-conflict reconstruction as the provision of general security, economic reconstruction, social reconstruction, and political reconstruction. While the provision of general security constitutes the precondition of a successful large scale reconstruction, economic reconstruction encompasses efforts to rebuild a country’s physical infrastructure and creation of rules and institutions that enable a market economy (Diamond, 2006: 176). Social reconstruction incorporates the efforts to enhance a vibrant civil society as well as the promotion of a political culture that fosters voluntary cooperation and limitations on state power (Jabareen, 2013: 119-120). Lastly, political reconstruction includes efforts to build a legitimate and capable state. In this respect, capacity-building concentrates on the issues of strengthening local institutions, transferring technical skills, and promoting appropriate policies.<br/>The passage( on the page, 130) explains that political reconstruction involves <strong>building a legitimate and capable state</strong>, which includes <strong>strengthening institutions, transferring technical skills, and promoting policies</strong>."

Conflict transformation addresses the underlying structures, cultures, and institutions that encourage and condition violent political and social conflict (Berghof Foundation, 2012: 23). Among the host of different conceptual interpretations, it is possible to identify four dimensions that are significant in the process of conflict transformation: • Actor-related transformation refers to individual changes in the emotional, perceptual, and spiritual aspects of the conflict.

    "explanation": "According to the UN, the core objective of peacebuilding is to reach the point when external assistance is no longer required by ensuring that all initiatives support the development of national peacebuilding capacities. Therefore, to achieve sustainable peace, the efforts should focus proactively on rebuilding national capacity. A common strategy that embraces diverse stakeholders and identifies national priorities is required to form the basis for the allocation of resources and to make an assessment of a country’s situation through a Post-Conflict Needs Assessment or Strategic Assessment (UN-PBSO, 2010: 5-6). As a significant feature of post-conflict peacebuilding, a common strategy should be comprised of an analysis of the main dynamics of conflicts and risks and consult diverse stakeholders in the planning stage.<br/>The UN's approach stresses that peacebuilding should <strong>build national capacity</strong> to the point that <strong>external assistance is no longer necessary.</strong>"

Despite their increasing use, third-party interventions are still underutilized, not because of their lack of applicability, but because those involved in a conflict are often not aware of their benefits.<br/>• Second, third-party interventions themselves require more research to become a more effective tool of international conflict resolution. Research is especially needed on how third-party interventions enable parties to manage intense emotional multi-party conflicts, imbalances of power, and cultural variations in the intervention process.<br/>• Third, international mediation must become more institutionalized.

States can promote both defensive and offensive goals through third-party interventions. States often combine defensive and offensive goals. They act defensively when a continuing conflict threatens the state’s interests. For example, in some situations, a conflict may threaten to escalate and draw in other parties. States fearing such escalation and expansion may seek to reduce the conflict to avoid becoming involved in hostilities. A conflict between two states may also upset a regional balance or provide opportunities for a rival power to increase its influence by intervening on one side of the conflict.<br/>The passage(on the page,164) explains that states may act <strong>defensively</strong> in a third-party role to prevent a conflict from escalating and affecting <strong>their own national or regional interests</strong>."

Concern for peace may be valuable in and of itself for many local leaders, too, as they believe in inherent desirability. Yet, most actors have an interest in enhancing their positions as useful third parties. They also feel valuable, believing that they have something to offer in the name of humanity and peace.<br/>The passage (on the page,164)states that local actors intervene partly out of <strong>self-interest</strong>, often to <strong>build their reputation</strong>, demonstrate <strong>usefulness</strong>, and <strong>contribute to peace</strong> from a position they believe has value."

From 1948 to 1978, only 13 peacekeeping missions were set up while there were no new missions deployed in the following ten years between 1978 and 1988. However, since mid-1988, the number of peacekeeping missions has been dramatically expanded.

For example, assisting democracy or certain governmental functions in states that have experienced civil wars depends upon local cooperation, and when this cooperation is denied, serious problems begin. Likewise, the establishment of safe zones in war-torn societies threatened the impartiality of the UN, as peacekeeping units utilized force to establish such areas and to protect them from external attacks. Even in the case of humanitarian relief, the delivery of aid often produced a failure of the UN personnel to think deeper about the root causes of conflicts. Above all, the central problem in the expansion of UN peacekeeping tasks is the blurring of the distinction between peacekeeping and coercive action.<br/>The passage (on the page,167)highlights the <strong>blurring of distinction between peacekeeping and coercive action</strong> as the central challenge."

As discussed below, through the lenses of international politics, local ownership should be seen as a power transferring to the local actors which would grant them the final decision concerning peacebuilding processes, including planning, management, and implementation, rather than bestowing a participatory role or consulting them. This power shift does not also mean a complete abandoning of outsider actors during post-conflict reconstruction and peacebuilding processes.<br/>The concept promotes giving local actors real authority in planning, managing, and implementing peace processes-not just participation or consultation."

The most important role we can play is to facilitate the processes through which various stakeholders debate and outline the elements of their country’s plan to address the injustices of the past and to secure sustainable justice for the future, in accordance with international standards, domestic legal traditions and national aspirations.<br/>According to the unit, peace operations should focus on <strong>supporting national stakeholders</strong> in creating their own reform agendas and justice plans through <strong>inclusive debate and planning</strong>, not by taking control or imposing solutions."

    },
    "explanation": "As this brief passage lucidly elaborates, which local actors to be involved, empowered, and collaborate with are selected by the international community. Accordingly, the agenda for peacebuilding is determined and framed by the outsiders as well. As mentioned earlier, local actors’ involvement in conflict resolution and postconflict reconstruction is a search for an acceptable juncture which would balance the tension between outsiders’ normative and operational goals and intrusion into the domestic affairs of the host country with minimum imposition. In this respect, the ideally acceptable threshold can be reached with the involvement of a vast majority of local actors and regarding their interests.<br/>It is suggested that balancing external influence and domestic autonomy requires the meaningful involvement of diverse local actors whose interests are considered in peacebuilding efforts."

    "explanation": "Designation of capacities, priorities, and expectations: One of the main lessons taken from post-conflict processes and practices is the right management of expectations (Chesterman, 2007: 20). In some cases, both local and international actors are likely to inflate capacities of the others and themselves, which end up in unrealistic goals and expectations that cannot be fulfilled with the existing resources and capacities. To prevent this kind of situation, priorities must be designated mostly by the local actors, and the transfer of resources and funds should be regulated by the donors and international organizations accordingly. For instance, the decision of “choosing, for instance, whether girls’ education should have a bigger budget priority than clean water” (Malloch Brown, 2003 [quoted in Chesterman, 2007: 9]) should be made by the local actors. By the same token, outsider actors should evaluate their operational and technical capacities and probable contribution before acting and engaging in conflict<br/>The passage,on the page 201, emphasizes that while <strong>locals set the priorities</strong>, <strong>external actors (such as donors)</strong> must evaluate their real capacity before getting involved in post-conflict recovery.

    "explanation": ". Reaching local actors and transmitting information: Securing participation and inclusion of local actors is another difficult task to implement.

This selection is understandable since elites have greater technical and material capacity. However, this kind of a strategy jeopardizes the sustainability of peace given that it ultimately undergoes local elites’ dictation and foreigners’ imposition and further bears the risk of re-construction of the status quo ante that triggered the conflict. In this situation, cultural sensitivity and equity emerge as essential pillars of sustainable peace.<br/>The passage(on the page 202) explains that focusing too heavily on elites risks repeating the same structures that caused the conflict, as it excludes the broader public and reinforces top-down control."

Civil society’s primary roles are taking responsibility for homegrown solutions and producing grass-roots peace projects to contribute during conflict resolution and post-conflict peacebuilding. <br/>3. Institutionalization of grassroots is a primary goal for the inclusion of civil society to conflict resolution and peacebuilding processes. <br/>4. Inclusion of civil society to conflict regulation and peacebuilding is not only a mere expectation but rather a requirement since these processes directly affect people who suffer from the conflict.<br/>Civil society is a vital, proactive agent that develops grassroots peace projects and must be institutionally included to effectively contribute to conflict resolution and peacebuilding."

    },
    "explanation": "The concept of transitional justice first appeared in the course of the ‘third wave of democratization’. The term ‘transitional justice’ was coined by Ruti G. Teitel in 1991 when the world witnessed a dramatic surge of countries transitioning from dictatorial or authoritarian regimes to democracy in Latin America during the 1980s and Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.<br/>Transitional justice emerged as many countries shifted from authoritarianism to democracy during the third wave of democratization."

      "E": "It considers transitional justice irrelevant to democracy-building."
    },
    "explanation": "Teitel, however, provides a narrower and more legalistic understanding of transitional justice, which has led her approach to be criticized for a number of reasons. First, her definition confines the scope of transitional justice only to post-authoritarian or post-communist regimes, but neglects war-torn, post-conflict societies. Second, she conceptualizes the ultimate aim of transitional justice measures as bringing liberal democracy to illiberal regimes (Nagy, 2008:277). Third, assuming ‘transition’ as a defined period ignores the fact that political transitions may last many decades. Fourth, by privileging legal responses to past human rights abuses, Teitel’s approach underestimates the role of extra-legal mechanisms, such as education and culture in dealing with the past (Roth-Arriaza, 2006:1).<br/>Teitel’s definition restricts transitional justice mainly to post-authoritarian or post-communist regimes and overlooks war-torn, post-conflict societies."

    },
    "explanation": "Most notably, a new institutional approach to justice that was developed in South American countries in the 1980s was the creation of truth commissions to investigate past abuses. Nascent democratic governments in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile established the first major truth commissions. Rather than simply holding former regimes accountable, new governments pragmatically prioritized other goals, such as peace, reconciliation, and healing of the entire society, that had been formerly external to transitional justice discourse.<br/>The truth commissions in countries like Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile went beyond just accountability.

    "explanation": "Based on the understanding of restorative justice, truth commissions form one of the most predominant and widely applied mechanisms of transitional justice. A truth commission refers to a temporary and non-judicial official body established to investigate past human rights violations. A truth commission is mandated to produce a final report based on the statements of victims and witnesses and serves as an official acknowledgement of past human rights abuses that were often denied or distorted by former regimes.<br/>Truth commissions are non-judicial bodies that document past human rights violations and provide official recognition of what happened, helping societies heal from denied or distorted truths."

    "explanation": "Truth commissions have been created under various names. Although the first was established in Uganda in 1974, early truth commissions were largely associated with the political transitions in Latin America from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. These early ones were created to investigate specific types of human rights abuses, particularly forced disappearances, committed during military dictatorships. The creation of early commissions was shaped by the political constraints of democratic transitions, and truth commissions emerged as political compromises between former regimes and new governments.<br/>Early truth commissions in Latin America were created to investigate human rights violations-especially forced disappearances-committed under military regimes.

Material reparations not only refer to financial compensation but also include access to land, healthcare, housing, or education, physical or psychological rehabilitation, the restoration of civil and political rights, and erasing unfair conviction records. Symbolic reparations, on the other hand, include apologies, memorials, monuments, and commemorations.
