    "explanation": "Among the theories of knowledge, empiricism as a way of reaching-knowledge, the basic assumption is that true knowledge can only be acquired through senses and observations. So, empiricists don’t accept a priori knowledge. Positivism is distinguished by four important assumptions. First of these is the belief about the uniqueness of science. According to this assumption which is called as naturalism in philosophical language, there is no important difference between natural world and social world and through the methodology of natural science, social world can be analyzed. Second assumption is that there should be a distinction between facts and values. In terms of philosophy, this point of view which is known as objective position assumes that objective knowledge can be attained by scientific methods despite the existence of subjective factors influencing the research. Third assumption is based on the belief that as in the universe or natural world, there are also regularities in the social world. In this way, as research is carried out, either deductive or inductive methods are employed. According to the final assumption, research must be based on the methods of empirical verification or falsification. The answer is D."

One of the important premises of realism (particularly neo-realism) is the anarchical structure of the international system. There is no central authority to govern the relations among states. Whereas for idealists, the norms and rules which are relevant to international law and international organizations should be applied to international relations for preserving peace and order.

The critics focusing on state-centric paradigm intensify as international relations get more transnational and the numbers of actors increase. After 1970’s a group of scientists led by J. Nye, R. Keohane and K. J. Holsti claimed clearly the invalidity of the state-centric approaches as a result of globalization and emerging non-state actors.

In other words, in such cases, public opinions, local characters, ethnic or ideological differences are not a point of concern for the researcher. Hence, in system theories, state is accepted as an entity responding to the effects from outside whereby internal features are ignored. In these models based on the system level of analysis, foreign policy is accepted as a response of state to the foreign environment.On the other hand, in the case of state level analysis, according to the theoretical framework used, state is accepted as the main determinant for foreign policy process and in some theories such as game theories, state is assumed to maximize its gains, but for realist theories state takes balance of power into consideration and tries to attain more power to survive. Taking the states to the core of research as mentioned above provides the researcher the opportunity to make concrete generalizations.Theories only focusing on individuals such as decision making theories and its models, foreign policy process is tried to be analyzed through behaviors of decision makers or political leaders. In this kind of analysis, individual is very central and also ideologies, motivations, values and beliefs are very important factors to be included to the analysis. The correct answer is C."

Among these, the classification as realism, liberalism and Marxism are very common. Since some concepts are being used to define these concepts, some others are using different identification for the same ones. For example, conservatism or Machiavelism as well as Hobbesianism could be used instead of realism. Similarly, instead of liberalism some scholars are using pluralism, Kantianalism or Grotianalism. The same conceptual difference would be for Marxism since some writers are using radicalism or globalism to define the same thing."

For realist scholars, human is naturally sinful, egoist, interest oriented, aggressive and all the time power seeking in character. In particular, classical realism depends on the opinions of Carr and Morgenthau, and explains the international politics through human nature. Objective laws which dominate human nature must be understood to conceive international politics. In other words, as long as these laws are neglected, IR cannot be figured out. Naturally, humans are created with negative evil character and has passion and vanity (Shimko, 1992: 286; Buzan, 1996: 50). Morgenthau and Niebuhr among leading post war realists explain IR with human nature. According to them, just like individuals, states also have negative characters such as interest seeking and aggressive. States seek persistently to increase their power and capabilities to the extent that they can take other states under their control. Therefore, in such a structure, war and conflict are normal processes."

Moral and ethical factors are not disregarded and international relations looks like nonzero sum game models of the game theories in which cooperation is the main feature instead of struggle for conflicting interests. This approach is also called as liberal/ idealist view. This Kantian approach sees international relations (IR) as a cooperation process, and there are certain rules restricting the states to use power rather than to see the international relations as a war among gladiators or struggle of interest between states as in the Hobbesian thought. According to this approach, there is no anarchy and no state of war in IR. However, neither complete struggle of interest like Hobbesian view nor complete harmony of interest like in Kantian thought is the real/exact situation in international relations. Therefore, international society reflects either of the both cases to some respect. There are international institutions and international rules binding on states."

    "explanation": "Studies in the field of International Relations (IR) are taken into account by dividing the discipline into two or three schools. For example:<br/>* “traditional theories, global society theories and neo-Marxist theories”<br/>* “realism, pluralism and globalism”<br/>* “conservatism, liberalism and radicalism”.<br/>* Machiavellianism, Grotianism and Kantianism<br/>There are some other categorizations which are not mentioned above, such as realist approach, rationalist approach and revolutionary/ cosmopolitan approach.<br/>As it is understood from the classifications and conceptualization, they all set forth the different aspects of the similar approaches. For example, the concepts of traditional classic theories, realism and conservatism are used to explain the basic arguments of the realist approach. Similarly, the theories of global society, pluralism and liberalism can be named under pluralism or liberalism. They can also be named under Kantianism, Grotianism communitarianism, cosmopolitanism and functionalism. The third group, which is classified with neo-Marxist theories, globalism and radicalism can be grouped with the concepts of Third World theories, Neo-Marxist theories, structuralist theories and dependency theories.<br/>There is NO mention of post-modern approach among all these divisions."

Statesmen conduct themselves in terms of interest defined as power.\n 3. Interest determines political conduct within the political and cultural context which foreign policy is formulated.\n 4.

Nations are entities that pursue their interests as defined by power and should not be judged by universal moral principles.\n 6. Political realism rejects the legalistic-moralistic approach to international politics.\n As seen in these principles, first classical realists, without denying the importance of anarchy, underlines the role of human nature. To describe this nature, Thomas Hobbes uses these words:\n <em>“… in the first place, I put for a general inclination of all mankind a perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth only in death”</em> (Hobbes, 2016).\n Simply put, man is naturally egoist and in a world of limited resources, he is guided by an endless will to gain power and it is this will that shapes his relations with others. As an animus dominandi, he constantly seeks to make others the subject of his domination. In realist perspective, this egoism and powerseeker (domination-seeker) character of human-being is also found as a constitutive element in every association and organization created by man. So, if international politics is all about power, it is the inevitable result of the reflection of human characteristic on international actors."

First of all, as a natural result of an international system with only two major powers, there are no peripheries. Secondly, the scope of factors those included in the competition is extended as the intensity of competition increases and “increased intensity is expressed in a reluctance to accept small territorial losses.” As a third characteristic of bipolar world, one must point out “the nearly constant presence of pressure and the recurrence of crisis.” Although it may sound, at first glance, a bit odd that this condition of permanent tension is considered to be a factor that encourages peace and stability, this assumption emphasizes the fact that “to fight small wars in the present may be the means of avoiding large wars later.” These three factors as the stabilizing particularities of a bipolar world, combined with a fourth element which is the preponderant power of major actors that help to achieve, in one way or another, comprehension and absorption of revolutionary political, military, and economic changes within the bipolar balance, are to be seen as sources of peace and stability. These are also the characteristics of the AmericanSoviet relations in the post-WWII era and in that perspective, they are considered to be generally effective to maintain the relative stability of this period and relevance of each factor is proved by various crisis examples of different degree such as Korea, Formosa Strait, Cuba, Berlin, Indo-China, etc.."

In this view, international arena is the scene of power politics and power, in that matter, it is conceptualized as both a means and an end in itself.

    },
    "explanation": "As different from defensive realism, even in the contrary direction, Mearsheimer, in his essay about future of the post-Cold War World, particularly Europe, emphasizes that a transition to a multipolar order from a bipolar one provokes instability. He argues that “the next decades in a Europe without the superpowers would probably not be as violent as the first 45 years of this century but would probably be substantially more prone to violence than the past 45 years” (Mearsheimer, 1993: 43). He affirms partially Waltz’s view by accepting that the anarchic structure compels states to compete for power for security and survival. However, the image of state portrayed by Mearsheimer is greedier and more aggressive than how Waltz pictures it. He claims that states seek hegemony; they all want to become, ultimately, regional hegemons. His theory, as it is called, <em>offensive realism </em>is built upon the assumption that “[G]reat powers… are always searching for opportunities to gain power over their rivals, with hegemony as their final goal” (Mearsheimer, 2001: 29)."

Their demands may be towards conflict or cooperation under different social conditions such as divergent beliefs, scarcity of materials and inequality in political power. This means that there is no automatic harmony of interests. An important source of social interests is globalization that offers transnational economic, social and cultural opportunities (2013, 711).</li> <li>States represent some domestic groups, whose interests shape state preferences. The nature of the state institutions and the societal demands shape the foreign policy.</li> <li>The interdependent state preferences shape state behavior, so the costs and benefits to foreign societies when dominant social groups want to realize their preferences are taken into consideration. Thus cooperation (its form, substance and depth) depends on patterns of these preferences and their influences on dominant groups in other states instead of realist priority on configuration of power. </li> </ol>"

The natural law denotes the customs and practices that serve as the general conditions to be preserved. Another key concept used by liberals is the spontaneous (natural) order which is composed of informal tacit contracts such as customs or conventions. The state is a set of governmental institutions and is a political entity. According to classical liberals, the sovereign (state) has three duties; (1) protection of its people from invasion of other states, (2) protection of each individual in society from oppression of other member(s) including protection of property and (3) provision of public services and sustainability of the societal institutions important for both individual freedom and peaceful coexistence.

Opposing to the realist dedication to nation-state as the focus of analysis, in liberal view, the political processes are foci and are formed through competition and cooperation among individuals and groups as agents (representing both state and non-state actors). According to liberal writers, structural theories such as neorealism lack a theory of preferences. In this connection, realism is criticized to be incapable of explaining globalization since it ignores the transnational societal interaction among agents.

    "explanation": "According to Andrew Moravcsik, there are three variants of neoliberal theory, the common ground of which is the relationship between social preferences and state behavior. Ideational liberalism discusses the effects of the conflict and compatibility of collective social values and identities as regards public (collective) goods provision (like geographical border, political decision-making processes and socioeconomic regulation) on state behavior. Commercial liberalism is about the effects of gains and losses of the people in transactional economics on the state behavior. Finally, republican liberalism is about the effects of the variants of democratic representation and rentseeking on state behavior"

They believed that the <em>developed countries could be models for less free countries through international trade and cultural exchange.</em> States communicate and negotiate through diplomacy and this maintains the stability. In the Grotian view, diplomacy is the bond between members of international society that converge around common norms and goals that is international law (rule of law at international level). Due to the anarchical nature of the international system that lacks a central authority, international law is enforced by the states themselves and the different interpretations of rules may lead to conflicts. Generally, states recognize that it is in their interest to conform to international law. According to classical liberalism, international law must be restricted to the international protection of individual rights. This has been the ground for the establishment of the international governmental organizations since the nineteenth century."

According to Mitrany, nonpolitical experts could better deal with their areas of technical expertise and initiate collaboration which in time would expand into other areas as well. The ever closer union of Western Europe increased the attention towards liberal integration theories and the question evolved this time around whether political integration could be achieved or not.\n<br/><strong>Ernst Haas</strong> was the one putting forward the assumptions of \"neofunctionalism\".\n<br/>The most well-known liberal internationalist <strong>Wilson</strong> in the aftermath of the WWI argued for a system of collective security to maintain peace, based on rule of law, instead of the old balance of power mechanism.\n<br/><strong>Robert Keohane</strong> listed three strands of classical liberal theory as (1) commercial liberalism about the pacific effects of trade, (2) democratic liberalism about pacific effects of republican governments, (3) regulatory liberalism about rules and institutions for relations between countries. Joseph Nye has added a fourth one (4) sociological liberalism about the effects of transnational ties on national attitudes and interests.\n<br/>The term interdependence (mutual dependence) entered the liberal terminology and was followed by the term transnationalism, which further supported liberalism’s pluralistic nature as regards international actors. The rise of the multinational corporations (MNCs) in world politics and their business transactions across the national boundaries of sovereign nation states increased the interest towards international political economy. The transgovernmental coalitions of the MNCs began to have steering role in economics and were closely related with politics as studied by <strong>Nye and Keohane.</strong>"

What these scholars expect is increasing institutionalization in different issueareas like trade, finance, environment, security and health under effects of globalization"

Second, the worker is alienated from the product of that activity, having no control over what happens to it. Third, the worker is alienated from other human beings, with competition and mutual indifference. This applies not only to relations with the capitalists, who use their control over the worker’s activity and product to further their own profit maximizing interests, but also to relations between individuals inside the working class as everyone tries to survive as best as he or she can.

      "E": "Finding new markets for products"
    },
    "explanation": "In the theory of alienation, Marx argues that workers in the capitalist society do not own the means of production, such as machines, raw materials, or factories. These are owned by the capitalists to whom the workers must sell their labor force. This system of labor displays four relations that lie at the core of Marx’s theory of alienation: First, the worker is alienated from his or her productive activity, playing no part in deciding what to do or how to do. Second, the worker is alienated from the product of that activity, having no control over what happens to it. Third, the worker is alienated from other human beings, with competition and mutual indifference. This applies not only to relations with the capitalists, who use their control over the worker’s activity and product to further their own profit maximizing interests, but also to relations between individuals inside the working class as everyone tries to survive as best as he or she can. Finally, the worker is alienated from the distinctive potential for creativity and community. As a result, workers gradually lose their ability to develop finer qualities as members of human species. The correct answer is B."

The interests of the capitalists lie in securing their power and expanding profits. Workers, on the other hand, have interests in higher wages and better working conditions. In order to realize them, they need a new distribution of power. These two major classes constantly try to promote their interests at the expense of the other and their goals are truly incompatible. In this battle, the capitalists are aided by their wealth, their control of the state, and their domination over other institutions, such as schools, media, and religious institutions that guide people’s thinking.

Whoever controls the economic system also controls the political system. Each period of history contains clashing forces, or a dialectic, from which a new order emerges. In ancient times, there were patricians, free people and slaves; in the Middle Ages, there were feudal lords and vassals; and in the capitalist era, there are capitalists and workers. So for Marx, all history, indeed, is the history of class struggle between a ruling group and an opposing one from which a new economic, political, and social system emerges.

In other words, it is said that the neo-Marxists that blame the Western countries for the underdevelopment of less developed countries display a rather reductionist approach, oversimplifying the situation. Sometimes, this approach may not even be true.\n Pelter T. Bauer states, for example, that there had been almost no economic growth in Africa before the Europeans arrived there. Indeed, trade and economic activities in Africa, especially in West Africa, vividly increased in conjunction with the commercial activities of the Europeans. Bauer further argues that the states that were not subject to Western colonialism, such as Liberia and Ethiopia, are currently more backward than those of their neighbors colonized. Moreover, the relationship between Western countries and colonial people is not just one-sidedly exploitative. On the contrary, through Western domination, colonial people began to experience literacy, education, science, even hygiene and sanitary methods.\n These examples in the question are given to criticise the view of neo-marxism that blaming the West for badness only in not true."

    },
    "explanation": "From the beginning of the 19th century to the First World War, the rapid expansion of colonialism and the Industrial Revolution occurred as a result of other major technological improvements in communications, transportation, and manufacturing processes. The European states needed raw materials found in colonies, hence international trade expanded, so did international investment. This way, capital especially moved from Europe to North America in search for higher profits. Throughout the 19th century, it, in a way, became necessary for European industrialized nations to expand their markets globally in order to sell products that they could not sell domestically in their countries. Besides, businessmen and bankers had excess capital to invest, and foreign investments offered the incentive of greater profits, despite the risks. The need for cheap labor and a steady supply of raw materials necessitated that the industrial nations maintain firm control over these unexplored areas. Only by directly controlling these regions, which meant setting up colonies under their direct control, could the industrial economy work without any serious problem (www. tamaqua.k12.pa.us).\n The era of colonialism brought about serious consequences, changing both Western society and its colonies. Through it, Western countries managed to establish a global economy in which the transfer of goods, money, and technology needed to be regulated in an orderly way to ensure a continuous flow of natural resources and cheap labor for the industrialized world. Yet colonialism adversely affected the colonies. Under foreign rule, local economies could not find a chance to grow. Imported goods wiped out local ones. This way, powers held back the colonies from developing industries. Colonialism also led to a cultural clash. By the start of the 20th century, Western nations had control over most of the globe. Europeans were convinced that they had superior cultures and forced the people to accept the Western way of life. The pressures to Westernize led the colonial people to reevaluate their traditions. But the good thing was Western countries introduced modern medicine that stressed the use of vaccines and more sanitary hygiene, helping to save lives and increase life expectancy.\n As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is A. The argument in the option I “Under foreign rule, local economies could not find a chance to grow. Imported goods wiped out local ones.” and in the option II “Colonialism led to a cultural clash. The pressures to Westernize led the colonial people to reevaluate their traditions.” can be used by the one who has been planning to underline the drawbacks of colonialism, so the correct answer is A. The argument in the option III underlines the good side of that period. The arguments in the options IV and V express the reasons in favor of colonists for the rise of colonialism."

The nationalists also believe that closing off an economy to external influences can be beneficial to growth and economic progress. Thus, economic nationalism can be defined as a mixture of trade protectionism and economic planning, with an aim to preserve national interests in the context of world markets.\n The main theorists of economic nationalism are Alexander Hamilton (1780-1804), the first United States Secretary of the Treasury, who wrote The Report on the Subject of Manufactures (1791) and Friedrich List (1789-1846), a Prussian economist, who wrote The National System of Political Economy (1841). According to them, the simple formula is that industrial power equals national power and national power equals independence (Hamilton, 2001; List, 1991).\n The rise of economic nationalism in recent history occurred particularly in the first part of the 20th century and it was essentially a response to the economic crises, nationalist movements, and enlarged states. In this respect, economic nationalism emerged as a criticism of economic liberalism as well. It is argued that states compete economically. This is very different from liberalism. The liberals believe that companies compete economically, but states do not. However, the nationalists see companies as elements of state power. So from this point of view, while Ford and McDonald’s, for example, contribute to United States power, Honda and Fuji contribute to Japanese power. The nationalists also believe that free trade only benefits the wealthiest, most advanced nations. In headto-head competition, the advanced or “mature” industries can easily defeat the less advanced or “infant” industries.\n As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is C. The arguments in the option III “Closing off an economy to external influences can be beneficial to growth and economic progress.”, in the option IV “The simple formula is that industrial power equals national power and national power equals independence.” and in the option V “In headto-head competition, the advanced or “mature” industries can easily defeat the less advanced or “infant” industries.” can be used by a debater who advocates economic nationalism. The arguments in the option I “Political leaders should allow trade among nations to expand and keep government intervention in that trade down to a minimum.” and “The government should be out of foreign trade, as well as domestic economy, as much as possible.” are the arguments in favor of economic liberalism."

    "explanation": "The liberal approach can perhaps be best summarized by the writings of Adam Smith (17231790), a famous English economist. Smith argues that the key to national wealth, and therefore national power, is economic growth. The key to economic growth is free trade, the free flow of goods, services and investment across borders. Hence, political leaders should allow trade among nations to expand and keep government intervention in that trade down to a minimum. This means that imports and exports should flourish with as little restriction as possible (Smith, 2003).\n As also undertsood from the information given the arguments in the option III and in the option IV are the arguments of economic liberalism approach and can be evaluated as the ones which do not not conflict with the arguments of economic nationalism by the one who advocates economic nationalism, so the correct answer is D.\n The ones in the option I “Free trade only benefits the wealthiest, most advanced nations.” and in the option II “The simple formula is that industrial power equals national power and national power equals independence.” are the arguments of economic nationalism."

    "explanation": "Economic structuralism, on the other hand, is concerned with the international division of labor created by the capitalist system. It sees that the division of labor is unfair, creating categories of rich and poor people, as well as rich and poor nations, at the macro level. Within the structuralist approach, there are actually two sub-approaches: the Marxist approach, which rejects capitalism completely, and the dependency approach, which aims to reform it. Particularly Karl Marx (1818-1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) created a great amount of literature outlining a theoretical critique of capitalism. The best place to look for details would be Marx and Engels’ The Communist Manifesto (1848) or Marx’s The Capital (1867).\n As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is D.

    },
    "explanation": "In the late 19<sup>th </sup>century, the gold standard system was first adopted by the economically-developed nations, under the leadership of the Great Britain, the hegemonic power at that time. The gold standard was a monetary system where a country’s currency or paper money had a value directly linked to gold. With the gold standard, countries agreed to convert paper money into a fixed amount of gold. A country that used the gold standard set a fixed price for gold and bought and sold gold at that price. That fixed price was used to determine the value of the national currency (Bryan, 2010). Until the First World War, most countries in Europe were on the gold standard. Yet with the war, the system collapsed, because of the declining power of Great Britain and of the terrible economic conditions during and after the war. Even though there were some efforts to return to the safety of the gold standard in the second part of the 1920s, this did not last long due to the stock market crash, or the Great Depression, in late 1929. Therefore, the interwar period was basically an era characterized by financial instability and low level of international trade, with no vivid economically hegemonic power. The Great Depression, the worst economic crisis in the history of the industrialized World, began after the stock market crash of October 1929, which sent Wall Street into a panic and wiped out millions of investors. Then the Second World War erupted in late 1939, lasting about six years. Towards the end of the war, a stable finance and monetary system was aimed to be established by the Western countries fighting against Nazi Germany under the leadership of the United States. To that end, delegates from 44 countries met in the United States, in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire in July 1944. The Bretton Woods Conference, formally known as the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, was held from July 1-22, 1944. The main goals were to ensure a foreign exchange rate system, prevent competitive devaluation, encourage international trade, and eventually promote economic growth.\n With the intention of realizing these goals, the Bretton Woods Agreement was signed on July 22, 1948, whereby the so-called Bretton Woods system came into being.\n In 1958, the Bretton Woods system became fully functional, as national currencies became convertible. In order to convert currencies, countries settled their international balances in dollars, while United States dollars were fully convertible to gold. As also understood from the information given, the correct chronological order of the events in the options is “I, II, III, IV, V”, so the correct answer is A."

    "explanation": "The Bretton Woods system was eventually dissolved between 1968 and 1973. The overvaluation of the United States dollar led to concerns among the members of the system over the exchange rates and their tie to the price of gold. In August 1971, President Richard Nixon announced the “temporary” suspension of the dollar’s convertibility into gold. While the dollar had struggled throughout most of the 1960s within the parity established at Bretton Woods, this crisis marked the breakdown of the system. A later attempt to revive the fixed exchange rates failed and by March 1973, major currencies began to float against each other.\n Even though the Bretton Woods monetary system itself collapsed this way, the so-called Bretton Woods institutions, which were set up along with the Bretton Woods Agreement, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), now the World Trade Organization (WTO), have survived, still directing international trade and finance to a great extent.

    },
    "explanation": "The theory of hegemonic stability holds the assumption that the world system is most prosperous when there is a hegemon to organize the international political and economic system. Historically, the periods of the Dutch (162072), British (1815-73), and United States (post1945) hegemony are commonly cited as evidence of the link between hegemony and prosperity (Kindleberger, 1977, 1981). When hegemony breaks down, it is assumed, the international system falls into disorder, with the resulting decline in peace and prosperity (Keohane, 1981). As also understood from the information given the correct answer is A. “The world system is most prosperous when there is a hegemon to organize the international political and economic system.” and “When hegemony breaks down, it is assumed, the international system falls into disorder, with the resulting decline in peace and prosperity.” are the assumptions which the theory ofhegemonic stability holds. However, some scholars argue that hegemony is a self-defeating and hence, temporary condition. While the hegemonic state bears the burdens of organizing the international system and supplying public goods, free-rider states prosper and increase the burdens on the hegemon. At some point, the hegemon comes to the conclusion that it is unable to bear the costs of the system it has created. So either it begins to put domestic interests over its international obligations or it becomes too weak to realize its widespread commitments. The Great Britain’s decline in the late 19th and early 20th century can be cited as an example of that (www. pugetsound.edu/what-is-ipe)."

      "E": "I, II, III, IV and V"
    },
    "explanation": "The history of MNCs is closely related to the history of colonialism. Some of the first multinationals were directed by European monarchs in order to conduct expeditions. Many of the colonies that were not held by Spain or Portugal were under the administration of some of the world’s earliest multinationals. The East India Company, which showed up in as early as 1660, founded by the British, was one of them. It was headquartered in London and took part in international trade and exploration with trading posts in India. Some other examples include the Swedish Africa Company, founded in 1649, and the Hudson’s Bay Company, which was incorporated in Canada in the 19th century. However, the MNCs, as we know today, did not really appear until the 19th century. That was due to the rise of industrial revolution. The development of the factory system; that is, capital-intensive manufacturing processes, combined with better storage techniques and faster transportation, rapidly brought about the emergence of many MNCs. During the 19th and early 20th century, the search for natural resources and pressure to protect or increase markets drove transnational expansion by companies almost exclusively from the United States and Western Europe. As also understood from the information given, all statements with regard to the history of MNCs in the options are correct, so the correct answer is E.\n Right after the Second World War, the United States-based MNCs heavily dominated foreign markets for a few years. Then from the 1950s on, European and Japanese MNCs started to show up and in time, they quickly increased in number. At the same time, major technological advances in shipping and communication accelerated the expansion of these MNCs almost all over the world. By the early 1970s, major MNCs had come to control about 70-80 percent of the world trade outside the centrally planned economies. Over the past half century, particularly after the end of the Cold War, there has been an obvious proliferation of MNCs. For example, while in 1970, there were some 7.000 parent MNCs, today that number has jumped to roughly 38.000. Approximately 90 percent of them is based in the industrialized world, controlling over 207.000 foreign subsidiaries. The large number of MNCs can be somewhat misleading, however, since the wealth of MNCs is actually concentrated among the top 100 firms (Greer and Singh, 2018)."

      "E": "I, II, III, IV, V and VI"
    },
    "explanation": "MNCs have long been subject to serious discussions. Advocates of MNCs argue that they create job opportunities for many and technologically advanced goods. It is also said that MNCs tend to establish operations in markets where their capital is most efficient or wages are lowest. By producing the same quality of goods at lower costs, multinationals reduce prices and increase the purchasing power of consumers worldwide. Some liberal economists go further than extolling the economic benefits of MNCs, pointing a positive relationship between the international liberal economy and peace. It is argued that through enhanced international trade and growing interdependence, national differences would vanish and increasing economic well-being would eventually lead to world peace (Mingst and Arreguin-Toft, 2011). Those opposed to MNCs, on the other hand, say that multinationals have undue political influence over governments, exploit developing nations, and create job losses in their own home countries. In addition, they argue that MNCs tend to develop a monopoly for certain products, driving up prices for consumers. MNCs are also said to have a detrimental effect on the environment because their operations may encourage land development and the depletion of local resources. Moreover, the introduction of multinationals into a host country’s economy may lead to the downfall of smaller, local businesses as well, since MNCs have better products and they can afford to even offer them at lower prices, as they have the financial resources to buy in bulk. Some critics further claim that MNCs breach ethical standards, accusing them of evading ethical laws and leveraging their business agenda with capital (Evans, 1979; Dunning, 1981). As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is C. The arguments in the option IV “Multinationals have undue political influence over governments, exploit developing nations, and create job losses in their own home countries.”, in the option V “MNCs are also said to have a detrimental effect on the environment because their operations may encourage land development and the depletion of local resources.” and in the option VI “The introduction of multinationals into a host country’s economy may lead to the downfall of smaller, local businesses as well, since MNCs have better products and they can afford to even offer them at lower prices, as they have the financial resources to buy in bulk.” can be expressed by the one who is opposed to MNCs. The arguments in the option I “MNCs create job opportunities for many and technologically advanced goods.”, in the option II “By producing the same quality of goods at lower costs, multinationals reduce prices and increase the purchasing power of consumers worldwide.” And in the option III “Through enhanced international trade and growing interdependence, national differences would vanish and increasing economic well-being would eventually lead to world peace.” can be expressed by the advocate of MNCs, not the one who is opposed to MNCs."

      "E": "I, II, III, IV and V"
    },
    "explanation": "It is a fact that after the end of the Cold War, the globalization of the world economy has been occurring at an extraordinarily rapid pace. Accompanying the process of globalization, however, it has appeared as a trend counter to the benign vision of economic and political harmony from more open borders. While it is true that in terms of national welfare, greater openness to competitive market forces, including competitive market forces from abroad, and greater freedom from artificial market restrains are closely associated with higher economic growth, as well as higher standards of living, there are basically five areas posing a serious challenge to economic globalization and the triumph of economic liberalism. These include high-tech trade rivalry, trade discrimination, unpredictable economic crises, North-South inequalities, and illicit market. As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is E. All of the areas in the options are posing a serious challenge to economic globalization and triumph of economic liberalism.\n <ul> <li>High-Tech Trade Rivalry: As opposed to the predominant win-win nature of conventional trade interactions, special concerns have arisen about trade competition in high-tech sectors, such as telecommunications, advanced materials, computers, bio-chemicals, and so on. Economies of scale dictate that only a few countries actually enjoy the presence of a critical industry that has important economic and defense ramifications. From any country’s point of view, strategic trade industries are valuable not only because they incorporate a large proportion of high-wage, highskill jobs, but also because they are likely to generate economic, social, or defense-related benefits. Therefore, countries generally desire to ensure the presence of their own country’s companies in strategic industries.</li> <li>Trade Discrimination: As the world is moving toward internationalism fast in the post-Cold War era, it has become fashionable to argue that trade discrimination among nations is now over. This argument was also supported by the successful completion of the Tokyo (1973-1979) and Uruguay Rounds (19861994) of trade negotiations in the past. However, the observable reality is quite the otherwise. Even not counting the impact of natural determinants of trade patterns, such as geographic proximity or absolute size of the nations in question, we have seen the emergence of great trade blocs in Europe, the Western hemisphere, and Asia in the post-Cold War period.</li> <li>Unpredictable Economic: Crises Another serious issue is unpredictable economic crises. As argued above, international economic relations have become truly global in the post-Cold War world. Communications are instantaneous and the world economy operates on all continents simultaneously. Thus, wherever the origin of a crisis arises, it inevitably affects almost all countries of the world.</li> <li>North-South Division: The post-Cold War period also witnessed the resurgence of North-South economic antagonism, resulting from deep inequalities between the two sides. Not counting exceptions, the North, in general, refers to developed northern hemisphere countries, while the South refers to underdeveloped or developing southern hemisphere countries. Indeed, the North-South confrontation is not new. It has occurred before in international arena. However, in accordance with the decline of ideological clashes, it has recently begun to occupy a more significant agenda in international affairs (Yılmaz, 2012: 91).</li> <li>Illicit Market: Finally, the clandestine side of globalization in the post-Cold War era has showed itself in the rise of illicit market, or sometimes called black market. The illicit market refers, in a generic sense, to economic activities that circumvent the institutional rules. To be more specific, what makes a market illicit can either be the illegal nature of goods and services themselves, or the illegal ways of their transaction. Thus, illicit market activities may include the illegal movement of commodities to evade tariffs, trade restrictions and sanctions, or the illegal movements of the banned materials, like drugs, human organs, endangered species, even protected intellectual property.</li> </ul>"

      "E": "Market functions best when it is free of government interference."
    },
    "explanation": "Economic liberals believe that individuals act in rational ways to maximize their self-interests, that when individuals act rationally, markets are created to produce goods and services that people need, and that market functions best when it is free of government interference. At the international level, international wealth is believed to be maximized with free exchange of goods and services on the basis of comparative advantage. Economic nationalism, on the other hand, refers to an ideology that favors state interventionism in the economic sphere. The nationalists believe that closing off an economy to external influences can be beneficial to growth and economic progress. Thus, economic nationalism can be defined as a mixture of trade protectionism and economic planning, with an aim to preserve national interests in the context of world markets. Economic structuralism, finally, stresses that the relationship among individuals, society, state and the market, in general, can be characterized by severe competition which is conflictual and exploitative. By extension, the relationship among states, which support owners of the means of production, is also conflictual because of inherent expansion of capitalism. It is also argued that constantly expanding markets of capitalism inevitably lead to economic crises, and dangerous speculation by holders of capital only exacerbates these crises. To eliminate economic problems and conflict inherent in the capitalist system, the capitalist system must be overthrown. The correct answer is C."

The exchange rate applied at the time was $35/ounce. The system had worked well for a while, but eventually dissolved between 1968 and 1973. The overvaluation of the United States dollar led to concerns among the members of the system over the exchange rates and their tie to the price of gold.

Besides, businessmen and bankers had excess capital to invest, and foreign investments offered the incentive of greater profits, despite the risks. The need for cheap labor and a steady supply of raw materials necessitated that the industrial nations maintain firm control over these unexplored areas. The era of colonialism brought about serious consequences, changing both Western society and its colonies. Through it, Western countries managed to establish a global economy in which the transfer of goods, money, and technology needed to be regulated in an orderly way to ensure a continuous flow of natural resources and cheap labor for the industrialized world. Yet colonialism adversely affected the colonies. Under foreign rule, local economies could not find a chance to grow. Imported goods wiped out local ones.

The purpose of regimes is to form a frame for facilitating the solution of problems through treaties. Regimes are not only making the cooperation easier in the short run, but also in the long run, providing an environment of cooperation for promoting relations.

In other words, regimes facilitate the identification of violations of rules in social, political and security related fields. Moreover, they also reduce the cost of common effort for those responding to such violations. According to Krasner, regimes make it easier to reach an agreement for parties, since it increases the communication among sides and influence the quality and quantity of knowledge in a positive manner.

Therefore, while the realist approach based on prisoner’s dilemma emphasizes that possible risks and uncertainties might cause to escape/refrain from cooperation, free rider approach also argues that the existence of some countries trying to employ the collective action without paying any cost might restrict the cooperation of states.\n Realists who are adopting the assumptions of uncertainty and prisoner’s dilemma assume that these mutual suspicion and non-confidence of states would feed and sustain the process. Therefore, international regimes would eliminate these uncertainties and feed the confidence instead of non-confidence.\n Moreover, conditioned cooperation (if game is reiterated, players would be encouraged to cooperate in order to escape from the probable cost) in the model of prisoner’s dilemma might be effective to encourage states to establish regimes. Meetings frequently done between states to boost the cooperation would be main imperative for realization of conditioned cooperation in prisoner’s dilemma.\n The correct answer is C."

      "E": "States will form regimes especially in areas where they have the opportunity to behave unilaterally."
    },
    "explanation": "Regimes are products of efforts to conciliate the conflicting interests, and also consequences of developments through which mutual interdependencies would increase the cost for conflicting relations among nations. Another important reason that leads to the formation of regimes is the multiplicity of interests of states as mentioned above. Therefore, if states don’t have common interests and/or states prefer the unilateral initiatives, then international regime would be impossible. Regimes formed between great powers would be stronger than those formed between weak states. As well, powerful states and coalitions that have vigorous competition cannot establish effective regimes. Therefore if states have less competition and strong common interest, this would lead to powerful regimes. At the same time, as noted earlier, since states would try to reduce costs by establishing regimes, if cost exceeds the benefits, then they would be reluctant to form regimes. For this reason, states should be persuaded and convinced for having common interests. In fact, states would hesitate to form regime in the field of their sovereignty, because regime would limit the sovereign rights of states in those areas in favor of international inspection and sharing their powers with other states. In particular, states would not be willing to share their power about legitimate use of power for internal issues. So they don’t prefer to establish common regimes in these domestic issues if they do not perceive a real threat to their rights inside the country. The correct answer is B."

    },
    "explanation": "Normative theories, essentially are related with the subjects of philosophy and ethic. Perpetual peace approach of Kant and European federation idea of J. J. Rousseau were interesting examples for normative studies. Value is always an important element for the background of normative studies, and such theories placed the discussion of politics in the context of morality. Here, moral factors became evident and interests were expressed through moral and ethical dimensions or in the context of values related to ideology, morality and politics (Johari, 1985: 72).<br/>However, normative theories rest on value preferences which cannot be tested or verified with factual experiments and this is an important difference from empirical/positivist theories. Moreover, they are not concerned with the proposition related to “what is” but “what ought to be, what should be” (Viotti and Kauppi, 1993:5;<br/>Rosenau, 1993, 25; Frost, 1986: 15).<br/>Empirical theories intensify on the real reasons of relations between statesmen and foreign policy. Diplomatic history introduces ample proofs for this perspective. From time to time, this contention is conducted in the axis of idealism-realism. However, the traces of the elements of value and norm would be seen in the studies carried out in the framework of realism as well. Therefore, this subjective factor could not be completely eliminated in empirical theories too. Empirical political scientists sometimes use the normative/philosophical concepts, even if they adopt empirical facts. In this context, coinciding theory and fact, inevitably, demonstrates the necessities that the empirical theories at the same time should utilize analytical approaches.\n According to these information the correct answer is option E."

According to him, an individual has the freedom to choose right, ethic and moral, and his behaviors are not determined in advance. But, he has responsibilities and obligations to perform and to obey to the ethical laws accepted as right by universal reason. The ethical laws are known to individuals, and they are universally obligatory<br/>rules for all humankind. The universal dimension of Kantian ethics is accepted as fundamental in IR. In Kantian idealism, there is an understanding of cosmopolitan international society which is composed of individuals, states and other actors adopting ethical principles. Right reason which has a different character transcends the law made by states, necessitates to fulfill states’ responsibilities stemming from universal law. This indicates the way toward the state of perpetual peace. A world federation formed by peaceful states was introduced by Kant as a recipe to solve the security demands of states. According to these information, the correct answer is given in the option D."

    },
    "explanation": "After 1960s, technological and ideological developments contributed to the arising of normative theories. During that decade, popular methodological debate was on the empirical/analytical theories and methodologies, and the scholars put aside the normative theories, and escaped to use normative standards and concepts such as right or wrong and just or unjust assumed as old fashion for the field of IR. Empirical/analytical theories in these years could not cope with the problems of difference among political institutions, practices and values. In 1970s, post-behavioral revolution emerged as a challenge against the so called behavioral revolution of 1960s, since behavioralism could not answer the contemporary needs, and became abstract by distancing from real world and ignoring the ideological elements for consideration of empirical conservatism. In this framework, some concepts such as value, purpose and preference lost their importance. Therefore, post-behavioralism moved to fill this gap, and in 1980s the problem was still not completely overcome, but at least normative theories regained their popularity. It was required to adopt a new idealist viewpoint that moral values would play significant role for policy making processes to reach a stable and peaceful world. In this framework, post-behavioralist scholars founded a theory which could be verified by empirical observations through synthesizing moral principles of liberal thought and rigid conservatism of realist approach (Dougherty and Pfaltzgraff, 1990: 565-66).

In addition to Butterfield and Wight, the book included contributions by other members of the Committee such as Bull, Howard and MacKinnon. The penultimate work that came out of the working of the Committee was published in 1984, titled The Expansion of International Society, edited by Bull and Watson. In-between, we see various works, either collective or individually authored, by members of the Committee or authors inspired by the works of the Committee."

    "explanation": "Although the British Committee was founded by an initial American funding, it has been a prevalent view in the literature of IR that the English School was somewhat posed against the dominance of American approaches to the study of international relations, especially American Social Science approaches, i.e. the Behaviouralist School, arguing that international relations can be studied with the use of the methods and techniques of the basic sciences. In the 1950s, there were two dominant schools for the study of international relations within the United States, namely Realism and Behaviouralism. In the Preface to Diplomatic Investigations, the seminal work of the British Committee, the editors starkly expressed their differences from the American colleagues."

    "explanation": "The British Committee met for the first time in 1959 and then worked well into the mid-1980s. Initially the Committee met 3 times a year and discussed the selected issues over a week. In time we see other scholars participate in the meetings of the Committee and also scholars who were inspired by the workings of the Committee such as R.J. Vincent, M. Donelan, J. Mayall, A. James, G. Gong, to name but a few. Martin Wight and Hedley Bull have come to be recognized as the most prominent scholars among the authors of the English School. \n The British Committee worked in the way that members prepared and distributed draft papers among themselves and then they discussed them over a week. The first publication of the Committee came out in 1966, titled Diplomatic Investigations: Essays in the Theory of International Politics, edited by Butterfield and Wight. In addition to Butterfield and Wight, the book included contributions by other members of the Committee such as Bull, Howard and MacKinnon. The penultimate work that came out of the working of the Committee was published in 1984, titled The Expansion of International Society, edited by Bull and Watson. In-between, we see various works, either collective or individually authored, by members of the Committee or authors inspired by the works of the Committee. It is fair to say that the British Committee thus led to the formation of a body of works, which we now consider as the output of the English School of International Relations.\n When one examines the composition and the working of the British Committee, some of the premises and arguments of the English School can be discerned. The Committee was composed of scholars coming from different disciplines, not just those coming from the discipline of IR."

    "explanation": "a positive definition of the English School can be made out of or within the British tradition. There may be identified four bastions from which the arguments of the English School are derived;\n 1. The empirical or historical tradition in epistemology, which could be traced back to Hume. Instead of rationalist explanations or abstract formulations<br/>as seen in Continental Europe and the United States, the British tradition generally relied on empirical analysis and historical explanation.\n 2. The cautiousness and refrain from the extremes and the pursuit of a middle<br/>way. Within the British tradition, one cannot find the salience of rigid and radical positions; instead, an effort to accommodate the extremes is highlighted.\n 3. The imperial and national tradition in which the diversity, rather than unity, was given prominence. Unlike the British tradition, the French, for example, emphasized the unity.\n 4. The diplomatic tradition. This tradition involved that the diplomacy must be given a chance until the last hour and resort to the use of force must be the ultimate choice."

      "D": "They are committed to holism in the sense that the whole is more than the summation of its parts.",
      "E": "They established that international relations as a field has existed for centuries, but has emerged as a subject field from the rise of colonialism."

    },
    "explanation": "Commonality of views, self-identification, and recognition by the community are the three conditions for the definition of a school. While historical lineage and evidence may seem important, the English School itself may also be traced back to arguments from the writings of scholars from previous centuries such as Hugo Grotius, Edmund Burke, and A.H.L. Heeren. Therefore, the first meeteing of the British Committee on the Theory of International Politics in 1959 is considered the birthplace of the English School as one can always take the traces of an event further back."

    "explanation": "The Cold War is the result of rising tensions between the U.S. and Russia/U.S.S.R. following World War II. The relationship between the two nations was borne out of their contact and the impact that their decisions had on each other, where each nation had to calculate their behavior in accordance with the other. The other examples are groups of states with common interests, and therefore bind themselves to a common set of rules in their relations with one another, forming a society of states."

      "E": "The rejection of presentism."
    },
    "explanation": "In time, English School authors have elaborated two versions of international society: the pluralist version and the solidarist version. This typology is an offspring of the order versus justice debate in international relations where pluralists prioritize order to justice, as an unjust system cannot be stable. Solidarists prioritize justice as an unjust system (even if it has order) is undesirable and ultimately unsustainable. This debate is a continuing argument between second-generation scholars that ties into international society as a core concept of international relations - the second basic argument of the English School."

    "explanation": "The English School has its main roots in the study of history, political theory and international law, whereas constructivism grew out of debates about epistemology and method. The distinctions of the English School from other schools and its merits are ontological and epistemological pluralism, its historical approach repudiating both determinism and presentism, and the significance given to values and cultural civilizational identities."

    "explanation": "Pluralists typically prioritize order to justice within the system as they argue that, although a deeply unjust system cannot be stable, order is in many ways a prior condition for justice. They also enphasize the significance of sovereignt, non-intervention, and cultural and political diversity."
