For example, smart contracts are used for record keeping which are triggered automatically when predefined conditions are met. Secondly, to address the transactions or as a registry of trade-able information, for example, as a dynamic distributed database that updates as payments in cash or cryptocurrencies are made among participants. In short, blockchain allows digital records and information to be shared in a secure, transparent, and immutable manner without centralized, trusted third parties such as a bank or a government agency (Gupta, 2018,p. 110 - 111)."

Variety - different types of data: Variety of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data and data sources (traditional and non-traditional sources from within and outside an organization). They include texts, web data, tweets, sensor data, audios, videos, click streams, log files, etc. 3. Velocity - data in motion: Velocity concerns the speed with which data is created, processed, and analyzed. It continues to accelerate with data created real-time. This enables decision making to be made instantly such as real-time fraud detection instead of detecting fraud after it takes place. 4. Veracity - data uncertainty: Veracity refers to the reliability of certain types of data. For example, weather and customers’ sentiments are inherently unpredictable."

    "explanation": "-There are two types of exporting: direct and indirect exporting. Direct exporting refers to the sale of products made by firms in their home country to customers in other countries. This strategy is attractive because firms can reach foreign customers directly. When domestic markets experience some downturns, sales abroad may compensate for such drops. Indirect exporting involves selling<br/>through domestic-based intermediaries (such as foreign distributors, sales representatives, and local agents).\n<br/>-Export intermediaries perform an essential middleman function by linking domestic sellers and overseas customers who otherwise would not have been connected (Peng, 2014: 299-300).\n<br/>-Exporting has many advantages (Çavuşgil et al., 2017: 377-378):<br/>1. It increases overall sales volume, improves market share, and generates profit margins that are often more favorable than in the domestic market.<br/>2. It increases economies of scale, reducing per-unit costs of manufacturing.<br/>3. It diversifies the customer base, reducing dependence on home markets.\n<br/>-There are some disadvantages of exporting (Hill &amp; Hult, 2019: 439):<br/>1. Especially for bulk products, high transport costs can make exporting expensive.<br/>2. Tariff barriers can make exporting costly. Similarly, the threat of tariff barriers by the host-country government can make it very risky.<br/>3.

Similarly, the threat of tariff barriers by the host-country government can make it very risky.</li> <li>In indirect exporting, intermediaries often carry the products of competing firms and so have divided loyalties. In such cases, the intermediary may not do as good a job as the firm would if it managed its marketing itself.</li> </ol> The correct answer is C."

Such competitive advantages were often expressed in terms of the additional added value which the more successful firms in an industry were able to generate compared to its market rivals in that industry. Differentiation strategy is one of the these three generic strategies for businesses, each of which aims to help organizations achieve a competitive advantage. Market penetration, market development, product development, and diversification strategies are product-market strategies introduced by Igor Ansoff in 1957."

    },
    "explanation": "The diversification strategy is generally known as the riskiest strategy in the matrix. This is because, according to diversification strategy, businesses change both their product mix and their markets (Ansoff, 1957: 114). Simultaneous changes in the market and product mix cause this strategy to be known as risky. One of the main factors that determine the level of risk is how far the business departs from the existing products and markets. In other words, when pursuing the diversification strategy, if the business does not entirely leave its products and markets, the risk level would be lower. However, businesses encounter a higher level of risks when they radically diversify their products and markets."

    },
    "explanation": "Prahalad (1999) lists four significant trends that must be considered in the current discussions about strategy. 1. Recognizing the changes in the field of strategy: The deregulation and privatization of government-controlled industries, the rapidly changing technological environment, and access to new market opportunities in developing countries such as China, India, and Brazil and in transitioning economies such as those in Central and Eastern Europe offer businesses completely new strategic options and opportunities. Such an expansion provides businesses with new opportunities in the modern global economy. 2. Recognizing the effects of globalization: The globalization of business activities introduces new strategic opportunities and threats. Furthermore, although debatable, the distinction between domestic and international businesses has become obsolete. This is because , in today’s business environment, domestic businesses have to respond to the actions of global businesses in their local markets. Mass customization and quick-response strategies require international businesses to be responsive to local demands. 3. Recognizing the importance of timely response: Today’s competitive environment is so complex that even the validity of annual plans is in question. This is because organizations’ capability to deal with opportunities and threats mainly depends on how fast they take action for these opportunities and threats. 4. Recognizing the importance of innovation: Although innovation has been considered as one of the critical success factors of businesses, it has become increasingly important in today’s dynamic business environment. Successful businesses still have to innovate their products, services, and processes. Furthermore, current innovations are expected to provide businesses with timely, reliable, and quick information about their customers."

Especially when the environmental conditions call for specialization, innovation, and meeting regional needs, the matrix structure could be an excellent organizational design option. On the other hand, there are a few disadvantages of the matrix structure. First, it may lead to problems in authority. The dual authority that is inherent in the matrix structure may cause problems for both employees and supervisors since subordinates report to two supervisors in the structure. When not appropriately managed, the matrix structure is prone to communication problems. Finally, the matrix structure is a costly structure. Offering constant training to the employees and supervisors, and establishing an effective communication system are the essential for a strong structure."

They include variation between assignments for the same employee, variation between expatriates of the same nationality in different countries, and potential reentry problems"

    "explanation": "It is not easy to manage human resources because employees come into companies with different educational backgrounds, occupations, motivation, gender identities, ages, and other various demographic and occupational features. On top of these, as firms go global, finding, managing, and retaining human resources become especially challenging because all of those activities become more complicated within the actual reality of different national cultures and ways of doing business in those cultures. Therefore, we need to define and understand international human resources management if we are to understand the business done on an international level.\n International human resources management (IHRM) refers to the planning, recruiting and selecting, training and developing, evaluating, and retaining employees for the international operations of international companies. In this chapter, international companies will be referred to as multinational enterprises. A multinational enterprise (MNE), also called a multinational corporation (MNC), is “a company that produces goods or delivers services in more than one country.” A multinational enterprise has its management headquarters in one (or rarely more than one) country, namely the home country (parent country), while also operating in other countries, namely the host countries (Eurostat, 2019). International human resources managers, usually located at corporate or regional headquarters at the home country, support subsidiary (host country) managers by providing IHRM guidelines and by finding, training, and evaluating employees for international operations.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements above related to international human resources management are correct."

    },
    "explanation": "In filling the positions at MNEs, each category of employees has its advantages and disadvantages. The preference of one category over the others is determined by the approach to human resources management in the MNE. Following the footsteps of Chakravarthy and Perlmutter (1985), four global strategies of MNEs are described next, together with the approaches they bring to staffing. These include ethnocentric, polycentric, geocentric, and regiocentric approaches. (Daniels, Radebaugh and Sullivan, 2015; Deresky, 2017; Geringer, McNett, Minor and Ball, 2016; Hill, 2013; Patel and Budhwar, 2017; Peng, 2011; Wild and Wild, 2016).\n The Ethnocentric Approach: An MNE is said to be following an ethnocentric approach when strategic decisions are made at the headquarters; and critical positions in both the domestic and foreign operations of an MNE are filled by personnel from the parent country (PCNs) with no or minimal autonomy delegated to the foreign subsidiaries. (Patel and Budhwar, 2017: 120).\n The Polycentric Approach: When an MNE treats each subsidiary as a distinct national entity, it is said to be adopting a polycentric approach. Acknowledging that the business environment and business practices in another country are different from those at the home country, the host country operation will be allowed more decision-making autonomy and will be staffed primarily by HCNs. This approach overcomes some of the shortcomings of the ethnocentric approach. Some MNEs use this approach in East Asia, Australia, and other markets that are deemed too expensive to staff with expatriates (Luthans and Doh, 2018).\n The Geocentric Approach: While the polycentric attitude strives for optimal local solutions, this might be sub-optimal for the whole organization. MNEs which think more globally in terms of their operations, recognizing that each part (subsidiaries and headquarters) makes a unique contribution with its unique competence are said to pursue a geocentric approach to staffing (Patel and Budhwar, 2017: 121). Here, all the subsidiary managers are regarded as equal to those at the headquarters. IBM is an excellent example of an MNE attempting to use such an approach (Luthans and Doh, 2018).\n The Regiocentric Approach: The regiocentric approach is a mix between the polycentric and the geocentric approaches. With the assumption that adaptation within regions is more comfortable than between regions (Morschett, Schramm-Klein, and Zentes, 2015: 512), the MNE divides its operations into geographic regions and moves staff within particular regions, e.g., Europe, America, Asia, rather than between regions. For example, countries from the Middle East are staffed with managers from the Middle East but not necessarily from the same country. Here, reliance on the regional group cooperation of the local managers takes precedence, and the regions operate relatively independently from one another. It will not be easy for the regional managers to be promoted to headquarters positions, but they can enjoy a certain degree of regional autonomy in decision making (Luthans and Doh, 2018; Patel and Budhwar, 2017).\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of them are the global strategies and the approaches of multinational enterprises (MNEs) they bring to staffing."

    "explanation": "Despite its advantages, ethnocentric staffing has its negative aspects too. Firstly, relocating managers from the home country is usually expensive. The bonuses that managers often demand and/or receive for relocating, plus relocation expenses for entire families, can increase the cost of a manager several times over. These high compensation packages can also lead to resentment among the HCNs with whom they are working. Secondly, being away from friends and relatives can be a severe source of stress for the PCNs. Thirdly, the more the host country’s culture is different from the home country’s culture, the more it puts pressure on the PCN. On the way to adapting to a new culture, poor decisions can be made because of not understanding the local customers and the needs of lower-level employees who are typically HCNs. Lastly, host governments can be discontent about this practice if they expect the MNE to employ locals in positions at any level. This disappointment may lead those governments to impose specific immigration laws and workplace regulations to force the MNE to hire locals.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

    "explanation": "Companies whose activities are highly international need employees with language fluency and in-depth experience in other countries. Meanwhile, small companies or those new to international business can begin with some basic cultural training. As a company increases its international involvement and cross-cultural contact, employees’ cultural knowledge must keep pace. Companies use many methods to prepare their employees for an international assignment. International assignment preparation methods are as follows:\n <ul> <li>Field Experience</li> <li>Language Training</li> <li>Sensitivity Training</li> <li>Cultural Assimilations</li> <li>Cultural Orientations</li> <li>Environmental Briefings</li> </ul> These methods tend to reflect an employee’s level of international involvement. The goal is to create informed, openminded, flexible managers with a level of cultural training appropriate to the duties required of them.\n <ul> <li>Environmental Briefings and Cultural Orientations: Environmental (area) briefings constitute the most basic level of training-often the starting point for studying other cultures. Briefings include information on local housing, health care, transportation, schools, and climate. Such knowledge is generally obtained from books, films, and lectures. Cultural orientations offer insight into social (i.e., history, religion, etiquette, food, and arts) (open textbook on HRM, 2016), political, legal, and economic institutions. Their purpose is to add depth and substance to environmental briefings.</li> <li>Cultural Assimilation and Sensitivity Training: Cultural assimilation teaches the culture’s values, attitudes, manners, and customs. The So-called guerrilla linguistics, which involves learning some phrases in the local language, is often used at this stage. It also typically includes role-play exercises. In a role-play exercise the trainee responds to a specific situation and is evaluated by a team of judges. This method is often used when someone is given little notice of a short stay abroad and wishes to take a crash course in social and business etiquette and communication. Sensitivity training teaches people to be considerate and understanding of other people’s feelings and emotions. It gets the trainee under the skin of the local people.</li> <li>Language Training: English is the language of world business, and it is quite possible to conduct business all over the world by using only English. Notwithstanding the prevalence of English, however, exclusive reliance on English diminishes an expatriate manager’s ability to interact with hostcountry nationals. A willingness to communicate in the language of the host country, even if the expatriate is far from fluent, can help build rapport with local employees and improve the manager’s effectiveness. The level of language training entails more than memorizing phrases for ordering dinner or asking directions. It gets the trainee into the mind of the local people. The trainee learns more about why the local people behave as they do. This is perhaps the most critical part of the cultural training for long-term assignments. Firms that offer foreign language training for expatriates believe that it improves their employees’ effectiveness and enables them to relate more quickly to a foreign culture, which fosters a better image of the firm in the host country (Hill, 2013).</li> <li>Field Experience: Field experience means visiting the culture, walking the streets of its cities and villages, and becoming absorbed by it for a short time. This can also be thought of as practical training, which is aimed at helping the expatriate and his/her family ease themselves into daily life in the host country (Hill, 2013). If the family is not included in the training and the international assignment, the alternatives will be a commuter marriage or an expatriate failure which are psychologically and financially expensive options (Wild and Wild, 2016). The sooner the expatriate and his/her family establish a routine, the better the chances are that they will adapt successfully. One critical need is - a support network of friends for the expatriate. Where an expatriate community exists, firms often devote considerable effort to ensuring that the new expatriate family is quickly integrated into that group. The expatriate community can be a useful source of support and information, which can be invaluable in helping the family adapt to a foreign culture (Hill, 2013).</li> </ul> As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of them are the methods used by the companies to prepare their employees for an international assignment."

    "explanation": "Industrial relations cover all aspects of employment relationships with particular attention to labor and management relations (Katz, 1988). Industrial relations is a broad concept encompassing many relations regarding the workplace. Kaufman (2008) classifies industrial relations under two distinct paradigms; the Original Paradigm and the Modern Paradigm. The Original Paradigm focuses on employment relations, and the Modern Paradigm focuses on unions and labor management relations. According to Dunlop (1958: 16), a national industrial relations system consists of four basic components (Figure 5.6), which are actors or parties (employees, employers, government), rules (both substantive and procedural resulting from mutual cooperation and oppositions between actors), an ideology (which binds separate actors one another), and the environmental context (as cited by Rahim, 2011: 66).\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements related to international industrial relations in the options are correct."

    "explanation": "IHRM is usually more complicated than domestic human resources management. In order to understand the complexity of IHRM, we need to understand its three dimensions. The dimensions of IHRM are activity dimension, regional dimension, and employee-group dimension. IHRM consists of different activities (i.e., recruitment and selection, training and development, performance appraisal and compensation, labor relations, leadership) which form the first dimension. The second dimension is related to the regional aspect which includes whether HRM is carried out in the home country, host-country, or other countries; and the third dimension is concerned with different employee groups, i.e., whether they are homecountry nationals, host-country nationals, or from other countries (third-country nationals) (Morgan, 1986;Morschett, Schramm-Klein, and Zentes, 2015)"

    "explanation": "<em><strong>External influences of the government and national culture: </strong></em>Employees must be hired, evaluated, and compensated in ways consistent with the country and regional customs and regulations. Laws govern work hours, the firm’s ability to dismiss or lay off employees, and severance compensation. These regional customs and regulations are frequent challenges in large MNEs. \n <em><strong>The mix of foreigners versus locals:</strong></em> Foreign subsidiaries are frequently staffed from the home country, the host country, and/or<br/>third countries. The mix of staff depends on several factors, including the international experience of the firm, the cost of living in a foreign location, and the availability of qualified local staff. As a result, the mix of foreigners and locals complicate IHRM.\n <em><strong>The need for an international compensation policy: </strong></em>Proper<br/>compensation packages become an issue, especially when there are higher costs of living in the host countries. Compensation packages may need to include allowances for housing, education, and other facilities<br/>that are not readily available in the host country. Establishing a fair and comparable compensation scale, regardless of nationality, is a frequent challenge in large MNEs.\n <em><strong>The need for defining the positioning of the product:</strong></em> Defining the positioning of the product is not within the scope of IHRM function. It is an issue within the scope of the marketing function."

Performance management is an extension of performance appraisal (Lindholm, 2000: 45), which is “a process that enables the MNE to evaluate and continuously improve individual, subsidiary unit and corporate performance, against clearly defined, pre-set goals and targets” (Dowling, Festing, and Engle, 2013: 151). In a similar vein, international performance management is defined as, “a designed, implemented and evaluated intervention of an MNE for the purpose of managing the performance of its global workforce so that performance at the individual, team, or organizational level contributes to the attainment of strategic global objectives and results in overall MNE desired performance” (Briscoe et al., 2012: 344). The essential components of international performance management include job analysis, goals which are defined at the individual, subsidiary, and global levels, and performance appraisal (Dowling and Welch, 2004). Based on job analysis, employees’ job goals and standards are defined, and their performance related to these goals is assessed. Goals at individual level lead to the achievement of subsidiary goals which is linked to the goals of a multinational organization."

The Original Paradigm focuses on employment relations, and the Modern Paradigm focuses on unions and labor management relations. According to Dunlop (1958: 16), a national industrial relations system consists of four basic components (Figure 5.6), which are actors or parties (employees, employers, government), rules (both substantive and procedural resulting from mutual cooperation and oppositions between actors), an ideology (which binds separate actors one another), and the environmental context (as cited by Rahim, 2011: 66)."

    "explanation": "Positioning is a strategy which aims to differentiate the brand in the consumer’s mind from the competitor’s brand in terms of the attributes and benefits offered by that brand. There can be three alternative scales: global consumer culture, foreign consumer culture, and local consumer culture (Keegan et al., 2017). Global consumer culture positioning means that the brand identifies a specific segment of the global consumer culture. For example, in the early 2000s, UGG boots became popular among the upper-middle-class global youth female subculture. An alternative positioning strategy is foreign consumer culture positioning, where the company associates the brand with a specific foreign country or culture. For example, Levi’s Jeans symbolically associates itself with America or the Wild West, Volkswagen associates itself with German Engineering by Das Auto slogan. Alden et al. (1999) argue that foreign consumer culture positioning is less common than global and local consumer culture positioning strategies. The final positioning strategy aims to associate the brand with the local consumer culture. McTurko in Turkey or McFalafel in Egypt are examples of local consumer culture positioning."

This perspective assumes that societies and markets converge in terms of their characteristics, such as similar values, tastes, lifestyles, and behavior as a result of globally operating multinational firms and the media. However, well-known global brands tailor their marketing activities to satisfy the local markets, which are shaped better by their local cultures than by those of the competitors’.

Interactions of ethnoscapes, technoscapes, and financescapes are unpredictable because each of these scapes is subject to different incentives or constraints that are political, informational, and technoenvironmental.\n Mediascapes and Ideoscapes have an image and narrative-based nature. Mediascapes are about the production and dissemination of information through different types of media where the boundaries between the real and the fictional blur. Mediascapes create and introduce imagined lives, places, and lifestyles.\n Ideoscapes are political, and they indicate mainly the spread of the Enlightenment worldview, which consists of notions like democracy, welfare, freedom, rights, and sovereignty.

Cultural values are internalized by interacting with the members of one’s family, getting rewards or punishments, negotiating what one wants, and causing and avoiding conflict.\n • Culture is interrelated within. Different parts of culture are connected, e.g., religion and marriage.\n • Culture is shared. Values are passed from one member to another."

    "explanation": "Usunier and Lee (2005) identify four significant elements of culture: language, institutions, material productions, and symbolic productions. Language helps the members of a culture to share and transmit information. It also shapes our thought patterns, our worldviews, and our behavior. Boroditsky (2011), a cognitive scientist, argues that Australian Aboriginals do not have the words for left or right in their language, and therefore their understanding of space is different from ours (Boroditsky, 2011). Institutions group people and ask them to conform to the rules in return for some rewards (Usunier and Lee, 2005). Family, political institutions, and gender are examples of social institutions defining social norms and roles. Material productions can be in various forms, e.g., artwork, intellectual productions, physical productions like tools, machines, or service productions like hospitals or media. Finally, symbolic productions determine the relationship between the physical and the metaphysical. For example, some religions ban certain food items. While the Hindu do not eat cow meat since the animal is considered sacred, Muslims have halal rules to obey."

In individualistic cultures, the independence of the individual is essential. In collectivist cultures group coherence and cultural harmony are more important than individual freedom.

A feminine society is supposed to value nurturing roles, interdependence, and caring for others.

In market capitalism, the role of the state is limited to establish competition between firms and warrant consumer protection. Production resources are privately owned. The opposite of market capitalism is centrally-planned socialism, where the state decides on what to produce and how much to produce. Consumers in this system can have access to what is available in the state-controlled market. In centrally-planned capitalism, resources are owned privately, but the state conducts resource allocation. Sweden has a centrally-planned capitalist economic system where two-thirds of all expenditures are state-controlled, and resource allocation is voteroriented.

Birth rates are higher than the others, but life expectancy levels are short. Literacy rates are low. Instability and unrest dominate the political environment. LICs generally have social, economic, and political problems, and international marketers generally regard them as having minimal opportunities to invest to enter and operate.\n Lower Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) are the ones with per capita GNI is between $ 1,046 - $ 4,125. They have growing consumer markets, which make these countries attractive for international marketers.\n Upper Middle-Income Countries (UMIC) or developing countries have per capita GNI between $ 4,126 - 12,745. Since urbanization is increasing in these countries, the number of people working in the industrial sector is also increasing, while that of those involved in agriculture is decreasing. Education systems of UMICs are reliable, and literacy rates are high. They have export-driven economies, and international marketers can face competition from local businesses.\n High-Income Countries (HIC) are the ones with per capita GNI is above $12,476.

These brands that belong to the L’Oréal Luxe line are distributed through department stores, cosmetics stores, travel retails, own-brand boutiques, and dedicated e-commerce websites.\n The second brand line, Consumer Products Division, offers its brands like Maybelline, Garnier, and L’Oréal Paris through retail channels like supermarkets or grocery stores.\n The third type of targeting strategy is a niche or concentrated marketing. Niche marketers serve a narrowly defined market within an international market or at the global level. For example, due to the advancement of digital photography, people lost interest in analog film photography. Recently, a niche market of young consumers who prefer alternative photography techniques, tools, processes, and nostalgic aesthetics and experiences has emerged. Lomography, a brand of analog photo camera, serves for this particular and narrowly defined global market (http-2)."
