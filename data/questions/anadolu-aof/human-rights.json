    "explanation": "Since “human rights” means different things in different historical and cultural contexts, and advocacy of such rights has frequently been challenged as subjective, it leads to search for a thoroughgoing objective criterion for human rights. In the eighteenth and nineteenth century, some European philosophers focused on the idea of “human rights” or “rights of man” as a body of rights which should be based upon a concept of human being. They developed a corpus of human rights to be afforded to mankind, and human rights found its legal expressions in the different legal, national documents.The correct answer is therefore A."

But some others, as Kuçuradi, rest on a different conception of dignity based on a distinct account of human being and of value. Every human being is considered as a valuable or dignified because of having some potentialities in him/his nature. “By the term of ‘the value of the human being’ ” Kuçuradi indicates the special place of this being occupies among other living beings.

    "explanation": "Greek philosophy is a convenient starting point to uncover the origins of human rights. Indeed, we need to look at the history of the concepts of natural law and justice in ancient Greek philosophy, if we want to examine the original beginnings of the idea of human rights. In Ancient Greek philosophy, to distinguish changing things from unchanging ones is considered an important issue. And the law of nature is seen as universal, immutable and eternal a set of regularities or of repeated patterns.These philosophers consider justice and injustice as if they are universal laws or laws of nature rather than concepts created by humanity. But Heraclitus apprehends that justice and injustice were man-made, and that God does not care about either. The correct answer is Choice A."

Their most important characteristic was the critical attitude towards knowledge, truth and laws. They believed that knowledge is relative and that social rules are not universal and immutable. The Sophists set physis, which means natural, against nomos, which means social law, and they set individual opinions against tradition. The most important contribution to the idea of natural law was the account of the <strong>Stoics</strong>. “The most dramatic mutation in the early relationship between physis and nomos was introduced by the Stoics” (Douzinas, 2000, 31). The Stoics claimed that people have certain rights by nature. They placed natural law at the center of ethics and politics."

    "explanation": "After the Magna Carta Libertatum, legal and juridical concepts had started to change.

Aquinas defines law in general as a role of human action determined by reason, directed towards the common good shared by all humans.” (Hayden, 2001, 43). Aquinas classifies four forms of law as eternal law, natural law, divine law and human law. These are the basic parts of law and related to human beings; namely their doing good and avoiding evil in their actions.The correct answer is D."

The political scientists and the historians, thoroughly appreciating its importance, have repeatedly come to the conclusion that the Declaration had no small part in the anarchy with which France was visited soon after the storming of the Bastille. They point to its abstract phrases as ambiguous and therefore dangerous, and as void of all political reality and practical statesmanship. Its empty pathos, they say, confused the mind, disturbed calm judgment, aroused passions, and stifled the sense of duty, -for of duty there is not a word. On the contrary, others especially Frenchmen, have exalted it as a revelation in the world’s history, as a catechism of the “principles of 1789” which form the eternal foundation of the state’s structure, and they have glorified it as the most precious gift that France has given to mankind (Jellinek, 1901, 1-2)."

The rebellion movements of the Barons were a result of the repression of the king and the authority of the King began to erode. King John (1166-1216) - King of England during that period - had several dissensions with the barons, just because of the protracted wars and high taxation that drive the society into a corner.

    },
    "explanation": "If it is compared with the current law practices, some articles as the article 39 may be seen the root of modern legal perspective. The article 39 of the Magna Carta states that ‘No freeman shall be arrested or imprisoned or deprived of his freehold or outlawed or banished or in any way ruined, nor will we take or order action against him, except by the lawful judgment of his equals and according to the law of the land’ and guarantees that the government will not act against its citizens except in accordance with the law. (Sol, 2016, 67). This article demonstrates the end of the unlimited authority of King, which might be called a revolution in the history of rights discourse as well. There has been a broad spectrum of amendments for over 800 years since this agreement, but the root of the fair trial thought was the article 39 of Magna Carta Libertatum. This article impeded the extrajudicial execution of the King, which expresses the main idea of the releasing trail in the current legal system."

    "explanation": "After the Magna Carta Libertatum, legal and juridical concepts had started to change. St. Thomas Aquinas has been one of the philosophers who contributed to these developments. “Aquinas produced a systematic introduction to theology, including the definition and classification of kinds of law. Aquinas defines law in general as a role of human action determined by reason, directed towards the common good shared by all humans.” (Hayden, 2001, 43). Aquinas classifies four forms of law as eternal law, natural law, divine law and human law. These are the basic parts of law and related to human beings; namely their doing good and avoiding evil in their actions."

    "explanation": "The first legal document Magna Carta and its amendments, with the philosophical account of right in it, have become a source of fire for the coming human rights legal documents. With the rebellion movements against the English parliament and monarch, claims for life, property and religious freedom became louder in England. <strong>Peasants and their demands</strong> about their basic needs triggered the human rights movements, even if there was nothing about them in any articles of the charter. Different classes of society were not represented in the parliament equally, and they were anxious for their rights. With the monarchical restoration, human rights thought that had been released by the English tradition was terminated. Yet the revolutionary spirit was still alive amidst peasants’ grief and despair. With the Great Revolution 1688, they fought for parliamentary and civil rights - later embraced by the English Bill of Rights"

    "explanation": "Another significant expression of this document was the article: “He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.” (United States Declaration of Independence, 1776) This article also exemplifies the liberal influence on the theory of human rights. With these articles, on the 4th of July in 1776, the United States of America was declared as de facto. Even though this article might have been seen as a declaration of independence, United States Declaration of Independence was more than the establishment of a state. Since, with this declaration as well as the Virginia Declaration of Rights, deliberation on human rights moved to another stage which was absolutely unfamiliar with previous ones. As of this declaration, all human rights documents have started with the quote “born equally” which comprises the main idea of respecting and protecting human rights."

President Franklin Roosevelt talked about four freedoms in his message to Congress.

    "explanation": "In its report, the ICISS introduced the concept of the Responsibility to Protect, which is commonly abbreviated as “R2P” (and also as “RtoP” in the literature). The main aim of the Commission was to shift the terms of the debate from the existence of a “right to intervene” towards establishing a “responsibility to protect”. Especially in the post-Cold War era, pro-intervention states have interpreted humanitarian intervention as a “right to intervene”, which meant that they could intervene if and whenever they wanted. Such approach is highly problematic from human security and international law perspectives. First, the acceptance of a right to intervene does not assure that there will be a timely response to mass atrocities. When humanitarian intervention is perceived as a right, it means that states are not obliged to take action but can or may do so if they want to. This, in return, as it was experienced in Rwanda in the 1990s, may result in inaction even when an intervention is obviously necessary to protect populations. Moreover, it does not include in its toolkit measures for enabling prevention or post-intervention reconstruction. Second, from a legal perspective, the interveners are not obliged to obtain the Security Council’s authorisation as humanitarian interventions can be carried out by a variety of actors (such as but not limited to a willing state, a coalition of states, a regional and/or international organisation) without an obligation to acquire consent or authorisation. Hence, as it was the case in the Cold War era examples, it makes unilateral interventions much easier and abuses of the doctrine more likely. Overall, such shortcomings constitute a challenge to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of the targeted state, as well as to the prohibition of threat and use of force (ICISS, 2001a, 16)."

On the one hand, restrictionists consider humanitarian intervention a violation of international law, mainly “a violation of the territorial integrity and political independence of the state”. On the other hand, counter-restrictionists argue that humanitarian interventions are permissible under customary international law and the provisions of the UN Charter promoting and protecting human rights. Moreover, they also emphasise that when a humanitarian intervention is undertaken as a collective conduct, it “expresses the will of the international community” (Duke, 1994, 33-35)."

The latter as an action is peaceful in character, and it is not in conflict with the notion of state sovereignty as its deployment is based on the consent of the host state. On the other hand, humanitarian intervention is a forceful measure that can be undertaken with or (most commonly) without the consent of the host state (Griffiths and O’Callaghan, 2002, 145-147). It is also important to note that humanitarian intervention is not a synonym for peacemaking or peacekeeping, which are conducts involving measures short of use of force and essentially carried out by UN-authorised missions (or missions of regional organisations)."

When and if there is a deadlock in the Security Council, then the issue may be transferred to the General Assembly.

Reflecting on the case of Syria, Hollande considered the veto as the core of the problem, and urged the permanent members to adopt “a code of good conduct”, which meant that on a voluntary basis the permanent members would commit themselves to not to cast the veto while considering mass atrocity crime situations (Gözen Ercan, 2016, 122)."

Its greatest significance is that it provides an authoritative guide to the interpretation of the relevant Charter provisions (Brownlie, 1993, 570). Moreover, it propounds the principles upon which binding conventions were based and rights which were going to be provided with binding power.

Many Western states also belonging to rich North debated whether the Covenants were a proper place for this right, since individuals use the human rights per se, on the other hand, the right of self-determination is a groups’ right. Nevertheless, majority of the member states were the newly-independent states from colonialism and they argued that if there is no self-determination there would not be human rights as well, since individuals would be deprived of the most basic human need and right.

The Charter consists of economic, social, cultural rights as well as those civil and political rights. The civil and political rights are to be found between the third and the sixteenth Articles of the Charter.

    "explanation": "The new objections to human rights are more<br/>radical and harsh, but mostly directed to the<br/>failure of human rights movement and the gap<br/>between the idea of human rights and its practice<br/>more than the idea itself. Though some critiques<br/>originate from postmodern thinkers who consider<br/>a transformation from grant narratives to small<br/>narratives, from human rights to the rights of<br/>children, to the rights of immigrants necessary<br/>and unavoidable; the others esteeming the idea of<br/>human rights in itself criticize the practice of human<br/>rights which seems them far from securing human<br/>rights to all members of the world community,<br/>referring especially the huge gap between the idea<br/>of human rights and its practice.<br/>On the other hand, the concept of “the right to<br/>have rights” introduced by H. Arendt triggered a<br/>chain of challenges to human rights as we observe<br/>in the accounts of scholars as Balibar, Agamben,<br/>Douzinas, Dembour and Rancière. Samuel Moyn<br/>decided to label human rights as The Last Utopia.<br/>Even though all of those scholars are partly<br/>sympathetic to the idea of human rights in principle<br/>and believe still its potential in creating a more<br/>human world, some argue that it has deviated its<br/>initial revolutionary discourse; and today “human<br/>rights have been turned from a discourse of<br/>rebellion and dissent into that of state legitimacy”<br/>(Douzinas, 2000, 7). M. Ignatieff identifies the<br/>crisis that human rights face today as a spiritual<br/>and cultural crisis related to both ‘intercultural<br/>validity of human rights norms’ and ‘the ultimate<br/>metaphysical grounding for these norms’ (Pedersen<br/>and Murray, 2012, 6). Many believe that human<br/>rights are in crisis in the beginning of 21th Century<br/>and the idea of human rights either will face an<br/>end or have to undergo some transformations to<br/>survive."

    },
    "explanation": "the concept of “the right to have rights” introduced by H. Arendt triggered a chain of challenges to human rights as we observe in the accounts of scholars as Balibar, Agamben, Douzinas, Dembour and Rancière. Samuel Moyn decided to label human rights as The Last Utopia. Even though all of those scholars are partly sympathetic to the idea of human rights in principle and believe still its potential in creating a more human world, some argue that it has deviated its initial revolutionary discourse; and today “human rights have been turned from a discourse of rebellion and dissent into that of state legitimacy” (Douzinas, 2000, 7). M. Ignatieff identifies the crisis that human rights face today as a spiritual and cultural crisis related to both ‘intercultural validity of human rights norms’ and ‘the ultimate metaphysical grounding for these norms’ (Pedersen and Murray, 2012, 6). Many believe that human rights are in crisis in the beginning of 21th Century and the idea of human rights either will face an end or have to undergo some transformations to survive."

Dembour tries to summarize these in the following three propositions which represents the main line of the conceptual critiques, “(1) the concept of human rights is wrongly presented as universal; (2) it pertains of a logic which focuses on the individual to the neglect of solidarity and other social values; (3) it derives from a reasoning which is far too abstract” (Dembour, 2006, 6). These three objections of human rights, namely the critiques of universality, of abstractness and of neglecting solidarity and other social values consist of the main critiques of human rights that will be elaborated in this chapter."

    },
    "explanation": "Though the objections of Dembour and Kapur portrait the conjuncture well, but do not cover all the critiques of human rights. “A different but complementary argument is developed by Alasdair Macintyre in After Virtue, when discussing the idea of human rights. According to him, not only are there no human rights, the notion of a right itself is not found in every society. After pointing out that claims to the possession of rights presuppose the existence of a set of socially established rules, he goes on, ‘Such sets of rules only come into existence at particular historical periods and in particular social circumstances. They are in no way universal features of the human condition’” (Milne, 1993, 4). Consequently, he comes to the idea that “‘It would of course be a little odd that there should be such rights attaching to human beings simply qua human beings ... .’Referring to the same linguistic facts, he then comments, ‘From this of course it does not follow that there are no natural or human rights, it only follows that no one could have known that there were ... .’ He concludes that there are no such rights’, adding that ‘Every attempt to give good reasons for believing that there are such rights has failed.’ His verdict is that ‘Natural or human rights are fictions’, and that ‘belief in them is at one with belief in witches and unicorns’”"

    "explanation": "“There is another objection to equating human rights with liberal democratic and modern socialwelfare rights. The particular values and institutions which these embody have their roots in the Western tradition of culture and civilisation. But the Western is only one of a number of such traditions. Others are the Islamic, the Hindu and the Buddhist, to name only three, each of which is based upon a great religion” (Milne, 1993, 3). Milne acknowledges this objection that casts doubt upon any idea of human right which presents it as a universal ideal standard, and he believes that such an ideal must be drawn from a particular tradition of culture and civilisation. And the people who do not belong to this culture will have no reason to accept it (Milne, 1993, 4). This objection is known as critique of cultural relativism. The cultural relativists deny the possibility of any universal value and ethical norm, and identify human rights as merely and inherently with western culture (Kao, 2011, 11). American Anthropological Association (AAS) made a statement against the Universal Declaration during the process of drafting, and warned the committee members about the possible negative consequences of a universal declaration"

Start, but most likely not finish. I am looking for the notion of human rights that fits into the best ethics that we can establish, and it is unlikely that the notion that history has yielded is already in perfect form for its place in ethics. One of the first things that one notices about the historical notion is that it suffers from no small indeterminateness of sense. When during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the theological content of the idea was abandoned, nothing was put in its place. The term was left with so few criteria for determining when it is used correct, and when incorrectly, that we often have only a tenuous, and sometimes a plainly inadequate, grasp on what is at issue. Its indeterminateness of sense is not something characteristic of ethical terms in general; it is a problem specifically, though perhaps not uniquely, with the term ‘human right’. We today need to remedy its indeterminateness; we need to complete the incomplete notion, and thereby most likely change it” (Griffin, 2008, 2)."
