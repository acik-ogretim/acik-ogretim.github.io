These historical developments were an aspect of the eruption of the global Islamic revolution, when Islam was on a march of conquest. Thus, new concepts of faith and politics rooted in the Quranic declarations that were promulgated in Medina and Mecca, declared by the Prophet, were embraced and enthusiastically implemented by the First Rashidun, successors of the Prophet, who swept over Arabia, the Middle East, and North Africa. Subsequent years saw the complete integration of the entire North African region into the Islamic world. The region became called the “Maghreb” by the Arabs. The correct answer is A."

The rise of the Persian Empire in the 4th century CE introduced a big threat to the Roman Empire. In 533 CE, Emperor Justinian, sensing the need for alliance, sent a letter to the Axumite Emperor urging him to block Persian silk trade through the Red Sea.

The classical period of Hinduism begins by 400 BCE and ends about 500 CE and is characterized by two great literary epics: the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.

    "explanation": "Hinduism has a caste system attached; Buddhism does not. Neither spread through military means. Hinduism tends to be more polytheistic (belief in many gods), but it maintains belief in one universal force, absolute monism, which however appears in three major forms - Brahma, the creator deity; Vishnu, the Preserver; and Shiva, the Destroyer (meant to be ridding the old for the new). Buddhism was initially quite simple, with its precepts embodied in the Four Noble Truths. It assisted the believer to a self-realization beyond the material world. But when it arrived in East Asia, it became more polytheistic. Moreover, in contrast to the tenets of religions such as Hinduism, which hold that only a few can only achieve ultimate enlightenment, Buddhism is open to all. However, the Buddha initially maintained that there were three truths about life in this world: sickness, old age, and death. After years of reflection, he developed a philosophy that is followed and practiced today. It does resemble Hinduism as it believes that life on earth is an illusion. The correct option is C."

To eliminate this suffering and achieve nirvana, an individual must follow an eight-fold path: right activities, right concentration, right effort, right intentions, right livelihood, right mindfulness, right speech, and right views.

    "explanation": "Theoretically, Varna had its origin in the sacred texts of the Vedic Period and the Epic Period, dated from before 1000 BCE to 200 BCE.

Since at that time, people lived a relatively simple agrarian existence, and there was originally a simple three-caste structure:<br/><ul><br/><li>The Brahmins symbolized the head of an organism.

Sudras received punishment for insulting Brahmins; reportedly, this included the pouring of hot oil into ears and the cutting out of the tongue. There were still examples of caste intermarriage, but they were rare. Untouchability now reached full bloom as Untouchables were forced to live apart and make their living in “unclean” occupations such as butchering. Occasionally, a Sudra might become an artisan or trader, and thus move up the caste ladder. However, primary social mobility was within the caste. The Vaisya caste has had dozens of occupations under the jati or sub-caste system so that success in business might lead to improved economic, if not social, status.<br/>The correct answer is E."

Many of basic institutions and ideas, such as universities, and representative assemblies, were worked out in the 12th and 13th centuries. But this Western (European) civilization was restricted to a very small area. Its center was in the North, in a triangle between Paris, Cologne, and London. The exterior countries such as Spain, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Bohemia (Czech Republic), and Italy - did not share in all the manifestations of this civilization; nevertheless, they accepted its basic ideas as Christianity. Furthermore, beyond these countries the impact of this new civilization dropped off sharply. It had little effect on the Moslem world or on the peoples of Africa and Asia who lived beyond the Moslem areas. It had some influence on Byzantium, but not enough to erase the variances that separated Byzantium from the West. The Mongol conquest of the 13th century weakened the ties that the Russians had with the West and forced them to face the East for two centuries. Great voyages of exploration and significant mechanical inventions both began in the 15th century,enabling Western (European) civilization to emerge from its narrow corner and spread throughout much of the world. Eastern Europe gradually accepted much of the civilization of the West. Three new continents - North America (principally colonized by the British, French, Spanish, and Dutch), South America (principally colonized the Portuguese and the Spanish), and Australia (with New Zealand) - were occupied by Europeans, and a fourth continent, Africa, was dominated by them (later to be colonized by European countries).

    "explanation": "Reformation - The revival of learning from the 14th to the 17th century is known as the Renaissance. It is viewed as the cultural link between the Middle Ages and modernity. Scholars who had studied philosophy began to question the Roman Catholic Church’s teaching and the administration of the Church by its leaders. Intellectually, there was an appeal for more reliance on Bible teachings - now increasingly available because of the printing press - and simplicity of worship. As a result, the Protestant Reformation began in Germany in 1517, when an Augustinian monk, Martin Luther, nailed his famous “95 Theses” -- a protest of the sale of indulgences (pardons for sins) -- to the door of a church in Wittenberg. Then, Switzerland, Scandinavia, Scotland, and several German states soon adapted the new religion, called Protestantism. In England, the break with Rome came when Pope Clement VII refused to allow King Henry VIII to divorce his wife, and this led to the organization of the Anglican Church. The Roman Catholic Church replied to the Reformation with its own Counter-Reformation, which began in 1560 and introduced reforms.<br/>The correct answer is B."

      "E": "After his death, Kiev lost its preeminence."
    },
    "explanation": "Although Vladimir’s son, Yaroslav the Wise (978-1054), waged frequent military campaigns, he also perceived dynastic marriages as a preferred way to maintain good relationships with other European countries. Three of his daughters became queens of Western European states (France, Norway, and Hungary). Of his sons, three married German princesses and the other one a Byzantine princess, while he himself was the son-in-law of the King of Sweden, and brother-in-law to the King of Poland. The UK historian Ronald Hingley dryly notes that for equally intricate Russian dynastic involvements with western Europe, one has to wait for the nineteenth century Romanov emperors. Upon Yaroslav’s death in 1054, however, his sons divided the state into warring factions, and the city of Kiev lost its preeminence."

His new capital, the city of Saint Petersburg, was now not only the center of the new Russian Empire but also a foundation of a new, modern society.

    },
    "explanation": "Hz. Mohammed saw the need for social rules to promise women the right of inheritance, and rights within marriage including the ability to start a divorce action. He believed that women were citizens and should have the right to have businesses and to own property. These were the issues that Hz. Mohammed wanted to work on in his community. So he began to travel to a nearby cave at Hira to meditate on these challenges. The cave was close enough to Mecca that he could see the Ka’aba from the cave while he was praying. On more than one occasion the Angel Gabriel (Cebrail) visited Hz. Mohammed at the cave. The Prophet’s experience in the cave at Hira began a miraculous journey. Because at Hira, the words of Allah were delivered to the Prophet by Gabriel (Jibrail / Cebrail). These is called the divine Revelations (Wahy-Vahiy). The visits to Hira, which often lasted several days, changed Hz. Mohammed from a hard working, trusted leader who was often looked to by his community to help settle disputes, into a teacher of spirituality who was the direct messenger of Allah. His reputation, and now his inspiration, enabled him to step into the role he was born to play, political and moral leader of a civilization that would spread across the entire planet.

    "explanation": "While Europe was struggling with the Dark Ages, and a feudal system that failed to develop wealth for any but the most privileged families regardless of merit, the Abbasid Khalifate expanded the iqta system of reward for military leaders in a way that dramatically increased agricultural production, while encouraging innovation, rewarding effort, and requiring respectful treatment of those who would spend their lives working the land. The iqta system encouraged these soldier/ landowners to maximize the productivity of their land. The Empire owned the land but it was granted to soldiers who had been successful. It could be taken back if these soldiers did a bad job of working the land, or even if they were unfair or cruel to their workers. Very importantly, these grants of land were not hereditary, although they could be bought and sold. All of this meant that the existing land of the Islamic world would be used more efficiently, yielding larger harvests, all while ensuring that citizens working the land were treated with respect. This was a feat of social engineering that has never been equaled, even today. Choice A is the correct answer."

There were actually a series of Persian Empires, stretching back to before the time of Rome. The first Persian Empire, or Achaemenid Empire, ended in 330 BCE, when Alexander the Great defeated Darius III. Several leaders of the Achaemenid Empire were not only King of Persia, but also Pharaoh of Egypt. Darius the Great was the most notable leader who was both King and Pharaoh.<br/>After the Greek conquest of the Achaemenid Empire, there was a brief period of chaos followed by the Parthian Empire. The Parthian Empire lasted from 247 BCE to 224 CE. Greek culture, installed in Persia after Alexander’s conquest, continued to play an important role in politics and commerce. This influence was passed on from the Parthian Empire to the Sasanian Empire, which ruled Persia from 224 CE to 651 CE."

    "explanation": "After his arrival in Medina, Hz. Mohammed invited the elders of various religious groups and tribes and suggested establishment of a city-state. All Muslims, Christians, Arabs, and Jews then ratified the Constitution of Medina. The pact transformed Medina into a small but the first ever Muslim State in the world’s history.

Using religion to force people to change their way of life ended. Hz. Mohammed was the only official leader of the newly founded group. Defense of Medina became the shared responsibility of the community.<br/>The Constitution of Medina is the first written civil and political law spelling out the religious autonomy and freedom. Tribal chiefs were allowed to settle their intra-tribal disputes. The Prophet, however, was to be the judge for disputes. The new constitution explained the responsibilities and rights of both the citizens and local leaders.<br/>Briefly, the Constitution laid down the principles of defense and foreign policy; organized a system of social insurance (called ‘Ma’aqil’); recognized Hz. Mohammad as the judge; and complete religious freedom was allowed."

    "explanation": "There are five main characteristics that distinguish Islamic civilization from other civilizations:<br/><ul> <li> Islamic Civilization is based on the monotheistic Islamic faith that believes in the oneness of the Almighty Allah, the Creator of this universe. It is characterized by submission to the will of Allah and service to humankind. It is a socio-moral and metaphysical view of the world.<br/></li> <li> It is a civilization with a universal dimension. It is not associated with a particular geographic region, race or historical era. It is based on the idea that man comes before the rest of the creatures of Allah. All human activities should lead to the happiness and welfare of man. Any action intended to serve this goal is a blessed action indeed.<br/></li> <li> It is an open civilization. Islamic Civilization has happily incorporated good parts of other civilizations, as long as they are not against the spirit of Islam (Iqbal, 2003: 10). Islam is the most pluralist religion; it coexists with other religions, allowing full religious autonomy.<br/></li> <li> It is a well-balanced civilization. It insists on a balance between the material and the spiritual life. This moderation is the essence of Islamic thought and civilization. It permits no excess, no neglect, no extremism and no recklessness.<br/></li> <li> It will last as long as Islam exists. So long as it embodies the principles of<br/>Islam, the Almighty Allah will preserve it. This unique civilization will never wither away because it is not a national or a racial civilization, nor does it run counter to human nature. Islam should not be identified with Muslims. Individual Muslims may become weak or strong, but Islam would remain an everlasting guidance to humankind.<br/></li> </ul>"

When the youngest of the brothers died, it would be the turn of the sons of the oldest brother. However, this system was never successful in totally preventing struggles for accession to the throne, given the abundance of princes who were just too impatient. At the end of the day, any member of the ruling clan had the right to claim the heavenly mandate (kut) to govern. Turks viewed the state as belonging to the ruling clan or tribe. Other than the main east / west division, there were territorial grants to nobles called ikta as payment for serving the state.

They crossed the Danube River and attacked the Eastern Roman Empire, only to be defeated decisively. As a result, the Huns left the Balkans for good. Two remaining Hun clans, the Kutrigurs and the Utrigurs, lived near the Sea of Azov until the end of the sixth century when they were overrun by Avar Turks, who had been running from other Turks. This latter group were starting the first Turkish Empire with the Turkish name in it: The Kok Turk (Göktürk) Empire."

    "explanation": "Food Crisis - Such a crisis stems from four main causes:<br/>• The production of biofuels takes over land for growing corn and sugar cane.<br/>• The increasing consumption of meat in the developed countries, as well as in China and India, requires an increased output of feed (seven or eight kilos of high-quality feed is needed per each kilo of meat) such as corn and soybeans.<br/>• Deregulating foreign food trade (towards the end of the 20th century) meant the destabilization of production, reserves, and the consumption of food in most countries.<br/>• The monopolization of food production is practiced by American companies, with four corporations dominating most farming business and bringing local farmers to bankruptcies; small farms produce healthy and tasty produce whereas those giants offer unhealthy and tasteless food."

    "explanation": "Food Crisis - Such a crisis stems from four main causes: • The production of biofuels takes over land for growing corn and sugar cane. • The increasing consumption of meat in the developed countries, as well as in China and India, requires an increased output of feed (seven or eight kilos of high-quality feed is needed per each kilo of meat) such as corn and soybeans. • Deregulating foreign food trade (towards the end of the 20th century) meant the destabilization of production, reserves, and the consumption of food in most countries. • The monopolization of food production is practiced by American companies, with four corporations dominating most farming business and bringing local farmers to bankruptcies; small farms produce healthy and tasty produce whereas those giants offer unhealthy and tasteless food."
