    "explanation": "• Ratios are representations of average conditions that existed in the past, and are influenced by the selection of accounting methods (e.g., weighted average vs. FIFO cost flow; accelerated vs. straight line depreciation);\n<br/><strong>• Since financial statements are based on historical data, they do not reflect price level effects and real economic values;</strong>\n<br/>• Computation of ratios are not standardized, and thus are influenced by data selection choices;\n<br/>• Changes in many ratios are strongly associated with each other; e.g., changes in the current ratio and quick ratio between two different times are often in the same direction, and usually proportional. Therefore, it is not necessary to calculate all ratios, and interrelationships between/ among the ratios should be investigated;\n<br/>• When ratios for the same company are compared over a period of time, care must betaken to analyzethe changes in operating conditions (e.g., changes in economic conditions, changes in product lines or geographic markets, changes in prices, levels of inflation, etc.); and\n<br/>• When a specific firm is compared with similar firms, differences between/among the firms should be recognized (e.g., accounting policies, type of financing available, operating characteristics such as product lines, size and geographical location).\n<br/>• The last, but the most important, consideration for the analysis is to obtain audited financial statements. Although unaudited statements might provide valuable information about a company, conclusions reached with this information are questionable, because its use brings up fair representation issues. Financial statement analysis is a multi-faceted issue. An analyst should consider all available techniques and ratios in order to produce useful reports to investors."

Bonds with longer maturity have a higher sensitivity to changes in market interest rates and have higher interest rate risk.\n Bonds carry reinvestment rate risk, which is the risk that cash flows received may not be able to be reinvested at the expected rates if market rates have changed. It is important when there is a decrease in market interest rates. When a bond investor makes a short-term bond investment, if market interest rates decline when this investment matures, the proceeds from short-term investment will be reinvested at a lower interest rate. Long-term bond investors face higher interest rate risk and will have a disadvantage when market interest rates increase whereas short-term bond investor faces higher reinvestment rate risk and will have a disadvantage when market interest rates decline.\n As also understood from the information given, all of the statements in the options about bond investors are correct, so the correct answer is E."

    "explanation": "Yield-to-maturity is the average rate of return that will be earned on a bond if it is bought at the market price and held until it matures. It is the discount rate that makes the present value of its future cash flows equal to its market price. It is like an internal rate of return of a bond.\n Calculating yield-to-maturity of a bond selling at par is easy. It is equal to its coupon interest rate. For discount bonds, yield-to-maturity is greater than their coupon rate whereas yield-to-maturity of premium bonds is less than their coupon rate.\n Yield-to-maturity has two components. The first one is the return you get from coupon payments, called current yield (annual coupon/current bond price).

Sometimes the managerial assessments are used as a contributor to the regression results.\n • Special Purpose Methods: There exist three special purpose methods to analyze the determinants of sales to make more realistic sales forecasts. The first one is industry analysis in which the individual company sales forecast is based on total industry sales. In the product analysis method, the focus is on individual product demand. It is also possible for some special sectors such as component manufacturing to use the forecast of the clients’ demand forecasts and this method is named as latest use method. \n • Combined Methods: It is the most proper approach to combine two or more of the methods mentioned above in order to fully address the company specific factors such as size, structure, suppliers and seasonality etc."

Preparation of Forecasts and Simulations: On the basis of the initial situation analyzed above and the establishment of a set of parameters or indicators, a set of forecasts and simulations of different contexts and scenarios can be prepared. These simulations are immeasurably helpful in making appropriate decisions on such crucial aspects as investments, profitability, changes in production systems, etc.\n 3. Detection of Deviations in the Basic Financial Statements: The basic financial statements are balance sheet, the profit and loss account and the cash flow statement. The analyses and tests to determine the deviations from the budgeted figures are fundamental part of financial control, since they permit problems, errors and deviations from the ideal situation or initial objectives to be detected early.\n 4. Correction of Deviations: Financial control would have very little practical use if the proper decisions relating to corrective actions were not taken to get the company accounts on theright track as previously established in the organization’s general objectives."

    "explanation": "1. Holding (or Carrying) Costs: This broad category includes the costs for storage facilities, handling, insurance, pilferage, breakage, obsolescence, depreciation, taxes, and the opportunity cost of capital. Obviously, companies prefer to keep low inventory level for the items requiring high holding costs and frequent replenishment. Inventory management aims to keep the inventories on optimal level, without stockouts and excesses, by organizing, holding and replenishments for each item.\n 2. Setup (or production change) costs: Production of different types of products, especially the new product types, requires the arrangements for required amount and type of materials, specific equipment setups and filling out the required documents, all of which requires additional costs which are named as set up costs. While the set up costs may change according to the product type and production process, generally small lots are produced. This would reduce inventory levels, with a resulting savings in cost.\n 3. Ordering costs: These costs involve the transactional, managerial and clerical costs to prepare the purchase or production order. Ordering costs include all the details, such as counting items and calculating order quantities. The costs associated with maintaining the system needed to track orders are also included in ordering costs.\n 4. Shortage costs: When the stock of an item is run out, an order for that item must wait till the stock is replenished, and whenever no replenishment occurs, the order is cancelled. This is called stock out. A stock out may cause production process to fail. On the other hand, a backorder occurs when the order is held and filled at a later date when the inventory for the item is replenished. Both stock outs and backorders create implicit and explicit costs, some of which are hard to measure such as estimate of lost profits, the effects of lost customers, or lateness penalties."

Companies should establish clear principles with regards to trade credits which includes the following aspects (Mishra, 1973):<br/>1. Allocation of Authority: The efficiency of a credit management in formulation and execution of sound and effective credit and collection policies largely depends on the location of credit department in the organizational structure. As credit and collection policies directly influence the solvency of the firm, they are considered to be under the responsibility of the chief finance officer. The other approach, referring to the receivables as a representation of sales and the value is not created until the collection is realized, proposes placing the authority of allocation under the direct charge of the marketing executive or the sales department. The choice of allocation of authority to administer credit and collection policies depends on either to a financial executive or the marketing executive or both of them jointly depending upon the organizational structure and the objectives of the company."
