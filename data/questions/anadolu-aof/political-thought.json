    },
    "explanation": "Since the formation of the first social groups, human beings have always been in need to reflect upon three issues concerning the politics: Power and authority, the way rulers should act/decide and how the system of ruling should be formed, revised or challenged. First systematic reflections on both how to govern and organize the society and the effects of particular policies can be traced back to<br/>the Ancient Greece.\n<br/>This is not to underestimate <strong>the contributions of the Ancient Chinese political thought, which was based on multilayered aphorisms on ethical conduct</strong>, or Hindu political speculation, which produced influential expressions of commitment to the political order in a rather didactic form. The answer is B."

    },
    "explanation": "People’s access to the material conditions of life sets the background of political debate. Expressing this through a famous statement, a well-known historical materialist, namely Karl Marx, claimed that “mankind always takes up only such problems as it can solve; since looking at the matter more closely, we will always find that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions necessary for its solution already exist or are at least in the process of formation” (Marx, 1904 [1859], pp. 12-3).\n<br/>From a general perspective, followers of historical materialist tradition perceived the social circumstances as putting their stamp on the way people formulate their problems regarding social justice, equality, social order and good government. Not the ideas that derive out from historical conditions and intellectual context, but the material conditions and the inherent contradictions within material circumstances were constitutive with regards to the history of mankind and history of political ideas."

    "explanation": "For Weber (1978) charismatic authority is the type in which the authority is believed to have unnatural superiorities or exceptional characteristics. People, according to Weber follow the charismatic figure “by virtue of his mission” and charisma sets its own limits.\n<br/>Nevertheless, it has a temporary character as charisma will wane into an institution, eventually being routinized. <strong>Traditional authority, on the other hand, feeds upon customs and convention</strong>. Being a source of conservatism, this type of authority also rests on identification with owner of the authority. Occupying the foreground is not, however, the transformative capacity of the rule or the organization, but rather provision of stability and preservation of social order. Legal-rational authority, as the third type of Weber’s classification, provides a source of legitimacy on a de-personalized and formal basis. The answer is B."

    "explanation": "Political theory, however, is based on argumentation and reasoned reflection. It is subject to systematic critical reflection, which has mostly been affected by the stamp of Ancient Greek thought. Ancient Greek tradition of political thinking produced a canon in both senses of the term: the first is a collection of works and ways of approaching to the “political”, deemed as inspiring sources of reference, and the second is pieces of melodies (regarded as themes) which are reproduced and imitated in other parts of the musical compositions (regarded as works of political theory)."

Contextual approach was one of these contributions. In broad terms, the contextual approach stresses the need to historicize the works of political theory in order to understand the particular historical moment and its impact upon the political thinking.

Explicitly criticising historicism and positivism, he recommended reading between the lines and unorthodox ways of interpretation according to the standards of his own time. For Strauss, studying political thought is “primarily and in a way chiefly... listening to conversations between the great philosophers... the greatest minds, and therefore... studying the great books.” According to the Straussian approach regarding with the political thought, universal human condition must be evaluated autonomously. According to this approach, various elements in political thought such as time and place are degenerating accompaniments for the abstract and clear form."

Its way of denigration of grand narratives places the postmodern approach at odds with the normative aspects of the modern political philosophy. As prescribing a set of reforms and particular steps to reach to the modernity’s “ought to be” situation would pave the way for consolidating a grand narrative, the postmodern approach rather emphasizes the constitutive role of the discourse and its formation. Briefly saying, instead of sticking to an “ought to be” situation of modernity, postmodern perspective constitutes its theory on discourse and its formation."

    },
    "explanation": "Max Weber, in its ideal typical classification delineated three sources of legitimacy. Ideal type approach here does not refer to a “preferred mode” categorisation but rather classification in thought - in abstract. According to Weber, charismatic authority is the type in which the authority is believed to have unnatural superiorities or exceptional characteristics. People, according to Weber follow the charismatic figure “by virtue of his mission” and charisma sets its own limits. Nevertheless, it has a temporary character as charisma will wane into an institution, eventually being routinized. Traditional authority, on the other hand, feeds upon customs and convention. Being a source of conservatism, this type of authority also rests on identification with owner of the authority. Occupying the foreground is not, however, the transformative capacity of the rule or the organization, but rather provision of stability and preservation of social order. Legal-rational authority, as the third type of Weber’s classification, provides a source of legitimacy on a de-personalized and formal basis. The authority of the organization or the political figure rests upon legality and bureaucratic organization acting in legal-rational terms. The legal-rational authority is mostly identified with the modern nation state by social scientists."

    "explanation": "The last quarter of the 20th century witnessed the rise of a de-constructive theory that is named as the postmodern theory. The postmodern approach to the political ideologies and thinking is an outcome of the critique of both contextualization and the Straussian understanding of political ideas. Therefore, the postmodern theorists questioned the notion of representation and the identification of social reality with the elements that supposedly represent the social world itself."

    },
    "explanation": "Max Weber, in its ideal typical classification delineated three sources of legitimacy. Ideal type approach here does not refer to a “preferred mode” categorisation but rather classification in thought - in abstract. For Weber, charismatic authority is the type in which the authority is believed to have unnatural superiorities or exceptional characteristics. People, according to Weber follow the charismatic figure “by virtue of his mission” and charisma sets its own limits. Nevertheless, it has a temporary character as charisma will wane into an institution, eventually being routinized. Traditional authority, on the other hand, feeds upon customs and convention. Being a source of conservatism, this type of authority also rests on identification with owner of the authority. Occupying the foreground is not, however, the transformative capacity of the rule or the organization, but rather provision of stability and preservation of social order. Legal-rational authority, as the third type of Weber’s classification, provides a source of legitimacy on a de-personalized and formal basis. The authority of the organization or the political figure rests upon legality and bureaucratic organization acting in legal-rational terms. The legal-rational authority is mostly identified with the modern nation state by social scientists."

Representatives of the third estate named Jacobins generally sat to the left side of the Estates General during the National Convention Period (1792-1795), while those who were supportive of the traditional institutions of the ancien régime, i.e. Girondins, sat to the right, and representatives from various streams sat at the centre (Plaine) (Ağaoğulları et al, 2015, p. 605). In the 19th century France, the terms left and right were used to delineate the supporters of the Republic vis-á-vis the supporters of the monarchy.

It always should be kept in mind that the Platonic philosophy is based on a non-egalitarian belief. His philosophy usually starts with underlining the importance of reason (logos). Therefore, he splits the being into object (material) and idea (thought). The human being has material and ideal sides. The ideal side .should govern the material side, namely the body"

Cynicism was a reactive movement against to the highly non-egalitarian society. The members of the movement were the lowest part of the society who was supported by the foreigners and exiles who were not given a right to citizenship. However, their egalitarian reaction to stratified society was not considerably successful in spreading among the poor.

The word cynic, in fact, is from an ancient word used to imply dog. Cynics’ primitive life style was resembled to life of a dog and, therefore, the name of “cynic” was given them by their political opponents. Cynicism was a reactive movement against to the highly non-egalitarian society. The members of the movement were the lowest part of the society who was supported by the foreigners and exiles who were not given a right to citizenship. However, their egalitarian reaction to stratified society was not considerably successful in spreading among the poor."

According to Al-Fârâbî, human beings collaborate as societies “in order to preserve [themselves] and to attain [their] highest perfections”. Without this, he emphasizes, “man cannot attain the perfection, for the sake of which his inborn nature [fitra] has been given to him”. In function of their size, associations can or cannot furnish the basis for a “perfect [kâmil] society”.\n<br/>This way of perfection attributes a goal to society, namely, true felicity (sa‘âdah). On Al-Fârâbî’s view, a city “… in which people aim through association at cooperating for the things by which felicity in its real and true sense can be attained, is the virtuous city [madina fâdıla], and the society in which there is a cooperation to acquire felicity is the virtuous society [ijtima‘ fâdıl]”.\n<br/>Al-Fârâbî also shares with Aristotle the claim that attaining the highest possible degree of perfection entails happiness; moreover, happiness is one of the key concepts of his thought. Al-Fârâbî’s conception of happiness is rather different from that of Aristotle’s notion of eudaimonia, because ultimate happiness, for Al-Fârâbî, is a state associated with the afterlife, when, the soul has separated from the body-regarding his conception of the soul. But how is ultimate happiness attained? Al-Fârâbî proposes an answer in line with the Ancient Greek thought; pointing out to a faculty which provides human beings with provision on one hand, and, basically formats reason on the other.\n<br/>As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is D. According to Al-Fârâbî, human beings collaborate as societies “in order to preserve [themselves] and to attain [their] highest perfections.

The format focusing on the individual ruler as a social figure, as well as his ideal characteristics and lessons learned from the preceding generations, the “Mirrors for Princes” format, which has an important role in the advising tradition in Islam (nasîhatnâmah); 2. The format in which the theory of the caliphate (imâmah) is put forward, which is more complicated in structure and focused on issues of government. Within the context of the first style, it is convenient to count The Advice to Kings (Nasîhat Al-Muluk); and within the second, Al-Ahkâm As-Sultâniyyah. Al- Mawardi’s main political thought is embodied in his Al-Ahkam As-Sultâniyyah. Only a small part of the work seems to be on political theory, while the rest is a discussion on the details of public administration and rules of government (Sharif, n.d.). But his small portion is extremely important because it is the first attempt in Muslim history to evolve a comprehensive theory of the State and because it has left an enduring influence on the course of Muslim political thought up to our own day. As also be understood from the information given, the correct answer is B.\n<br/>“The Incoherence of the Philosophers” was written by Al-Ghazâlî.

However, the analyses and the visionary thoughts on politics, civilization and history have overshadowed what were written in the remaining of Kitâba’l-Ibar; moreover, the studies on Ibn Khaldûn’s thought after his death (1406) have focused more on The Muqaddimah. In the Introduction of The Muqaddimah, Ibn Khaldûn started with setting forth his evaluation on the science of history; and in the First Book, with elaborating the following subjects and the reasons underlying them in general: the nature of ‘umrân in the world, and the rural life without the nomadic-settled distinction (bedâwah), sedentary culture and urban life (khadârah), taghallub (sovereignty over winning wars/battles), income, making a living, sciences and education, crafts, etc. This general content was separated into six chapters afterwards; and each subject, was elaborated and discussed in ‘encyclopedical’ details, so to speak.\n The first chapter consists of a description-in general framework- of the human civilization, its classes and the places occupied by those civilizations on earth. In the second chapter, the rural societies and their civilizations, i.e. the lives of the societies making a living on agriculture and stockbreeding in rather primitive ways, regardless of the fact that they are nomads or settled as villages, are taken up (In Ibn Khaldûn’s words, ‘badawî ‘umrân’). The third chapter-which also could be read as Ibn Khaldûn’s political theory/philosophy- is an analysis of the idea(s) of state, dynasties, caliphate, rulership and the stages in the organization of state as well as positions in bureaucracy and their duties. The fourth chapter reflects Ibn Khaldûn’s elaboration of the urban societies and their civilizations -i.e. ‘khadarî ‘umrân’, as well as cities and sedentary cultures. The fifth chapter briefly outlines Ibn Khaldûn’s theory of economics; and the majority of the chapter consists of the ways of making a living, in both stages of ‘umrân. The sixth and the last chapter covers an analysis of the sciences, how they are acquired, and transferred to posterity through education.\n As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is E."

Avicenna thoroughly studied the soul in its totality and in all its functions, whether rational, animal, or vegetative. He charted the operations of all the senses in detail, including the five external senses and especially the five internal senses located in the brain-namely, common sense, imagery (where the forms of things are stored), imagination, estimation (judging/guessing the imperceptible significance or connotations for us of sensed objects, like friendship and enmity, which also includes instinctive sensing), and memory-and how they could help or prevent or slow down the intellect in finding out the middle term and perceiving intelligibles more generally."

    "explanation": "Christianity is agreed to be indifferent to matters of slavery; which is also compatible with the Ancient Greek thought. The following quotations from the different parts of <em>The New Testament </em>show that slavery is not considered a big social problem in the eyes of Christianity. Moreover, Christianity advises slaves to be obedient to their masters, regardless of whether they are good or evil: However, there are also verses that refer to the equality and unity of all human beings-around the personality of Jesus Christ, which leads us to thinking that the social order making room for slavery is only a worldly illusion. On the basis of these quotations from the primary source of Christianity, it is possible to argue that even religions-including the monotheistic were inadequate in changing the socio-economic circumstances of the time they emerged. So, even the apostles of Jesus Christ did not have enough courage and confidence to forbid and/or to stand against slavery although Christianity is quite often advertised as “the religion of free will/freedom”."

    "explanation": "Despite the fact that Christianity did not condemn any property holding, and that medieval political writers had seen property as natural and right and demanded respect for it, Christianity seemed to suggest a type of voluntary poverty, and a type of sharing goods which might be related with communism. The early Christian community in Jerusalem seemed to be united towards this as a social ideal, which made them share a single heart and a soul (Kilcullen-Robinson 2017: 5). Following the ideals of early Christianity on voluntary poverty, the leading institutions of medieval Europe included monasticism and other forms of religious life, which praise poverty and communal living, instead of saving and claiming property (Kilcullen-Robinson 2017: 5)."

Despite these texts, the clergy accepted titles of honour and claimed authority and power. Worse than that, the Church saw itself as Christ’s kingdom on earth, and claimed a share in Christ’s power. Paul’s writings, in some sense, might be claimed to serve as a justification for the Church to do so: “…For what have I to do to judge them that are without? Do not you judge them that are within? For them that are without, God will judge, … (1 Corinthians 5: 12-13)”, was usually taken to imply that the Church has no jurisdiction over non-Christians (“them that are without” means <em>outside </em>the Church). However, the general history of civilisations is full of counter examples whereas the history of thought provides us with the opportunity to observe the gradual increase in the reference to the fullness of Papal power in the later medieval political writings. Therefore, it is possible to argue that The Church-as the fundamental institution-had characterised Christianity in a way that Jesus himself was unable to foresee."

Many of the Fathers were influenced by the Platonism and Stoicism, as every educated person became acquainted with in the ancient world. Augustine, who was particularly influenced by Neoplatonism, especially by Plotinus, could be seen as a milestone on the path from The Fathers of the Church to early scholastics (ibid).

A distinction among kinds of laws, namely natural law (ius naturale), law of nations (ius gentium), and civil law (i.e., the law of a particular community).\n<br/>2. A notion of rights, including natural rights (currently, “human rights”), which may be attributed to individuals. It is noteworthy that the language of rights, without which many people these days would not know how to talk about politics, did not fully enter political philosophy until the fourteenth century as a borrowing from the law,\n<br/>3. “The one liberty of all men”, i.e., the idea that human beings are basically equal and<br/>that slavery is contrary to natural law, though in accordance with the law of nations,\n<br/>4. The origin of property: according to some Roman law texts, property originated by natural law; according to others by the law of nations. According to canon law, property exists by human law (which includes the law of nations and the civil law); compare Augustine’s statement that property exists by the laws of the emperors,\n<br/>5. The doctrine that the source of political authority is the people, who have, however, entrusted their power to the emperor or some other ruler,\n<br/>6. The doctrine that either the pope or emperor (or both) has a “fullness of power”,\n<br/>7. The doctrine that natural law permits an individual to resist force by force; which would provide a premise for arguments for the right to disobey a tyrannical government, used later by John Locke (1632-1704),\n<br/>8. A distinction between Church and State more exactly, between the priesthood and the power of the emperor, each independent in its own sphere, though the priesthood has the higher function (ibid: 11-12)."

The city or state exists not just for security and trade, but to foster the “good life”, the life according to virtue (Politics III.9, 1280 a32-b35).<br/>3. Women should, in general, be ruled by men (Politics I.5, 1254 b13). The inferiority of women was already the general opinion, but Aristotle reinforced it, not only by what he said in the Politics but also by his biological theories.<br/>4. The good forms seek “the common good”, i.e., the good of both ruler and ruled. The best is kingship, the worst tyranny. “The common good” became a basic conception in medieval political philosophy.<br/>5. “The rule of law” is better than “the rule of men”, i.e., it is better to have rules impartially applied than to leave every decision to the unfettered discretion of the rulers.

It is natural for human beings to form cities. Political city life is natural to human kind.<br/>2. The city or state exists not just for security and trade, but to foster the “good life”, the life according to virtue.<br/>3. Women should, in general, be ruled by men. The inferiority of women was already the general opinion, but Aristotle reinforced it, not only by what he said in the Politics but also by his biological theories.<br/>4. The good forms seek “the common good”. The best is kingship, the worst tyranny. “The common good” became a basic conception in medieval political philosophy.<br/>5. A good form of government must be stable, not liable to revolution."

    },
    "explanation": "At this very point, in order to name 16th century capitalism as commercial capitalism, it is necessary to get into the further stages leading to industrial capitalism (Beaud, 2003:31). The issue that Smith and Marx named as exchange value increasingly gained importance in the 15th century. Money in the 16th century was yet away from going beyond a thing that met humans’ needs. It became a value for exchange of goods for new capitalist class and a means of making a living for masses (Harman, 2009:184). Cities were in the front line of a new economic growth as in printing and shipping in the middle of the 15th century (Harman, 2009). The effect of technical change and new market relations within feudalism led to a duality in economic and political relations, in which ways of capitalist and feudal behaviors and thoughts embraced as well as conflicted with each other (Harman, 2009). Thus, absolute monarchy already became a widespread form of government in the Western Europe in the early years of the 16th century. The absolute monarchy was a combination of blood and iron depending clearly on force to a great extend (Sabine 1969:3). Church, which was one of the most important institutions of the Middle Age, became the victim of social forces, on which the absolute monarchy depended. Church administrators increasingly came under the rule of the kingdoms, and in the end the legal authority of the church disappeared."

He attributes importance to passions in order to understand human nature, accepts that passions determine human behavior, and does not take passions in a negative sense. Passions can be observed and explained, according to Hume. Reason is (and should be) the slave of passions. It cannot act independently from passions; it has to obey them. Reason and passions have various functions; they cannot be opposed to each other. Reason, by itself, cannot constitute the means of motivation, but it can help distinguishing between the good and the bad about passions (Hume, as cited in Kırlı, 2013: 111)."

Machiavelli often expressed that there is evil in man’s nature. However, this conceptualization of evil is not of religious but of earthly. According to Machiavelli, the instinct that lies at the bottom of human behavior is the instinct of ownership. Because the human greed does not have a limit, individual desires and interests constantly conflict. For him, while some people would like to obtain something, the others are scared of losing what they already have. According to Machiavelli, who has a sense of power with zero sum, the amount of power does not change. An increase in one’s power means a decrease and even destruction in power of the others."

Calvinism exercised an apparently strong effect also in Germany, in the Wuppertal region as well as elsewhere, and the “reformed” faiths seem to have promoted the development of the capitalist spirit, as became especially clear in comparison to other faiths. Max Weber’s famous account Protestantism and the Spirit of Capitalism (1904/5), in which he interpreted the Calvinism of the seventeenth-century as an important source of modern economic practice. The broad outlines of the argument are familiar, though more often than not crudely caricatured. Weber was a subtle and perceptive student of history, theology, and economics. He never argued for a simple causal relationship between Protestantism and capitalism. Rather he identified the ways in which Calvinism contained a “spirit” or “ethic” that made possible the rise of capitalism and granted it legitimacy."

The political demand of various churches concealed the serious economic disorders that emerged parallel to the rise of modern trade and the collapse of the old economy. Utopia, which was written under these conditions, is a satire. The origin of the word utopia, which was created by Thomas More, is Greek. More used the prefix “ou”meaning “not” in front of the word “topos” meaning “place” and created this term which means nowhere, no place, anywhere, or placeless. He called his book Utopia, which he published in Latin in 1516. Since that date, the term has been generally used for a place that is outside the known boundaries of geographical world and human experience world.

People are equal in the state of nature: The main reason causing war in the state of nature is the fact that people are equal in terms of their physical and mental abilities.\n<br/>2. Inequality causes insecurity: Natural equality brings forth equality of the hope of achieving goals. Because every human being has equal chances with respect to achieving their goals, they have equal hopes. If they both want the same thing, the problem<br/>arises there.\n<br/>3. The result of insecurity is war: Individuals want to rule others and to dominate them to get rid of the state of insecurity. The state of equality requires to constantly cope with dangers to survive and to dominate others."

    "explanation": "Locke departs from the characteristics of human being and of the natural life to construct his political thought. In this thought, human individual is not created to live alone: s/he has to live in a society. The first society is constituted of the relationship between women and men. The society of parents and children follows the former, and the society of masters and slaves comes. These societies, however, differ from political societies in their aims and the responsibilities of their members. Human being, as a social being, is naturally equal and free. Locke claims that reason in the natural state teach all individuals that they are equal and free, and that they must not harm each other’s freedom, life, welfare and property. Individuals are also a part of God’s creation, and God directs them to good. Human beings, differently from any other animals, have reason and conscience. Human nature, therefore, is a virtuous combination of many elements, potentially: Moral, reasonable, egoist, and social elements."

Because the human greed does not have a limit, individual desires and interests constantly conflict."

Machiavelli distinguishes between the violence that is applied rightly and cruelties that are applied wrongly when a prince is coming to the power. However, this definition is not based entirely on a moral basis, and for him, it is an appropriate behavior for a prince to resort to violence intensely at a time in order to secure himself against threads. Once he defeats his enemies, a prince may leave aside ruling by means of violence and begin to take the most useful precautions for his subjects (Abramson, 2014, 191). In addition to this, the ruler should never stay away from the idea of war. He must struggle with this thought in peace more than in war. It can be in two forms: the first one is theoretical; and the other is practical."

Equality, according to him, is to have the equal rights for everyone to attain their own freedom, without being subject to any other’s will and authority. Freedom: Every individual has the right to make use of himself and his property in the way he wishes; however, he is not free to destroy himself or his property without a higher purpose than of its protection. The limits of freedom are determined by responsibilities derived from the natural law. Rationalism: Hobbes claims that equality and freedom direct us to rationalism.

The church continued not to abandon its traditional habits and regarded interest unethical. On the other hand, the church tried hard to centralize economic and political power in its hands. The fact that the church tried to centralize and protect its status quo led to the questioning of the Catholic universalism represented by the Roman Church. This religious universality would be dissolved with Renaissance and Reformation. The technological development that laid the groundwork for this new social formation was that the printing technology had been renewed. At such a time, Martin Luther lit the fuse of the Reformation movement. On October 31, 1517, he posted The Ninety-Five Theses to the door of the church of Wittenberg Palace. These theses had social and political demands as much as theological ones. These demands had three main consequences. 1. Catholic world was divided 2. The churches were brought under the control of the states. 3. The bourgeoisie used these these demands as a weapon against its opponents such as aristocracy and the Roman Catholic Church"

The political demand of various churches concealed the serious economic disorders that emerged parallel to the rise of modern trade and the collapse of the old economy (Sabine, 1969: 114). Utopia, which was written under these conditions, is a satire. The origin of the word utopia, which was created by Thomas More, is Greek. More used the prefix “ou”meaning “not” in front of the word “topos” meaning “place” and created this term which means nowhere, no place, anywhere, or placeless. He called his book Utopia, which he published in Latin in 1516. Since that date, the term has been generally used for a place that is outside the known boundaries of geographical world and human experience world."

Hume asserts that reason functions on the relationship among ideas and on those between ideas and phenomena. If reason has the ability to refer to morals, it has to be either one or the other, or the combination of both. Secondly, according to Hume, reason is (and has to be) the slave of passions. Moreover, he claims that a particular passion cannot be considered as rational or irrational. They might be based on correct or incorrect beliefs, or they may confirm or contradict with other passions (Monk, 2004: 166). Hume’s philosophical investigations define moral beliefs as individual experiences and emotions that emerge from the sympathies of the related parties."

All of the anarchists advocate that government is an obstacle that hinders human flourishing and progress. They all think that state should be totally or partly eliminated, but they have differences of opinion on the strategies. Yet no anarchist totally defends anarchy, because the most important form of government, that is, individuals’ self-governing will remain (Baradat, 1991, p.127). Some anarchists claim that all institutional governments must be eliminated for individuals to govern themselves. However, some others do not regard local level administration such as villages, communes, syndicates as obstructive structures. For them, abolishment of national states is enough. In short, anarchism is the expression of purest individualism and democracy, because it depends on the self-government of the individuals (Baradat,1991)."

    "explanation": "The value that workers produce above their<br/>wages, which is at the survival level, is called<br/>surplus value that is appropriated by capitalists as<br/>their profit. For instance, if a worker has to work<br/>five hours to produce the supplies for the survival<br/>of him/herself and his/her family, and s/he is forced<br/>to work 12 hours, yet paid only subsistence wage,<br/>it means that the capitalist seize seven hours of<br/>surplus value. Marx asserts that any profit that the<br/>capitalists make from the labor of their workers<br/>is exploitative, because the surplus value can be<br/>produced only by the worker and it belongs to the<br/>laborer. Marx did not condemn profit itself, but he<br/>argued that the profit should not become a private<br/>property of capitalists. He thought that capital,<br/>which was produced by all, should be owned by<br/>all. In other word, private citizens should not be<br/>allowed to monopolize the means of production<br/>and seize the surplus value. In capitalism, however,<br/>capitalist is “a villain, a parasite who lives by sucking<br/>the economic lifeblood of the proletariat, and must<br/>be erased from society”."

The relations of production between social classes are determined by the affiliation between humans and the means of production. The ruling class in every society consists of people who own the property of the means of production. Therefore, in a pastoral animal breeding society, the owners of the most of the livestock is ruling class. In an agricultural society, the ruling class consist of people who own most of the land and agricultural implements such as the ploughs.

In general, the intellectual life of Marx was shaped by a unique mixture of Hegelianism (I. Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, L. Feuerbach), French socialism (J. J. Rousseau, H. Saint-Simon, P.J.

Like Hegel, Marx also considered the dialectic as a means of accomplishing historical progress through struggle; yet he changed it since, for Marx, it was materialism which inspired the dialectic, not spiritualism.\n Marxism and Anarchism both (a) emerged as reaction to the severe oppression during the mid-1850’s, (b) are materialists, (c) accept Marx’s surplus value theory, (d) believe that working class has the potential to destroy capitalism and create a classless society, (e) believe that the only way to destroy capitalism is revolution. The main differences among them are largely related to state. According to anarchists, the reason of class existence is the state, if there were no state, the society would be a classles one. Thus, if the state is eliminated, the classes would not exist anymore. Marxists on the other hand, considers that the state is the consequence of the class conflict. They consider that the capitalist state must first be overthrown in order to defeat capitalism. However, after the revolution, a proletarian state will take place and protect the achievements of the proletarian revolution."

    "explanation": "Marx believed that humans express their creativity, develop their humanity, and fulfill themselves through work. Work, in other words, is a form of self-creation. However, work under capitalism causes alienation. Alienation is the process through which the workers become foreign to their labor, species, and themselves. workers became a part, a gear of the machine they operate.\n The three aspects of alienation can be summarized as followings (Cuff et al, 2013, p. 24-6; Baradat, 1991, p. 157-8; Swingewood, 1998, p. 86-97):\n <ul> <li>First, the working conditions were very heavy in the 19th Century and work itself became a form of persecution for workers rather than a joyful process of the selfcreation. Work under these conditions was physically disturbing and did not provide mental satisfaction. But, they had to work to earn their livings. Therefore, they became alienated from their own selves.</li> <li>Second, workers became a part, a gear of the machine they operate. They worked even without knowing what exactly they were producing, because they were deprived of the information about the whole process of production. The labor of the worker was taken away from him/her and was transformed to an external entity. The physical, objectified form of their labor was the product, and these products were used to exploit them further by capitalists. Workers did not work to produce for their needs; they worked to produce commodities which will be sold for profit of the capitalist. Therefore, they became alienated to their labor and to the products they produced. As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is D. The statements in the options I, II, III and IV are related to the labor aspect of alienation. The statement in the option V is related to the becoming alienated to themselves.</li> <li>Third, working under these conditions, workers were also alienated to their species, their population, and their fellows. They only felt free in their spare time and were encouraged to be interested in their selves. In addition, the population of the industrial society was divided into two groups, one of which lived in physical comfort and was able to participate in creative actions freely whilst the other was degraded to a lower category who had to work under poor, dirty and severe conditions of the 19th Century factories.</li> </ul>"

      "E": "I, II, III, IV and V"
    },
    "explanation": "In his surplus value theory, Marx adopts Ricardo’s iron law of wages. Ricardo asserted that the fundamental motivation of capitalists is to make profit and accumulate capital. Therefore, they would pay wages just enough for the survival of the workers, because this wage is enough for the workers to come back to work the next day. The function of this subsistence wage is to prevent workers from accumulating enough capital to gain independence from the production process. Marx considers that capitalism enslaves workers because they have to work in order to survive, and the means of productions are owned by a small group of capitalists. In short, workers are wage slaves in capitalism, and “their masters pay them only the most meager wages” (Baradat, 1991, p. 159). Under Ricardo’s iron law of wages, the workers’ intrinsic value is the money just enough to feed themselves and their families. However, workers are forced to produce value which is greater than their intrinsic value. The value that workers produce above their wages, which is at the survival level, is called surplus value that is appropriated by capitalists as their profit.\n As also understood form the information given, all of the statements related to the surplus value in the options are correct, so the correct answer is E. For instance, if a worker has to work five hours to produce the supplies for the survival of him/herself and his/her family, and s/he is forced to work 12 hours, yet paid only subsistence wage, it means that the capitalist seize seven hours of surplus value. Marx asserts that any profit that the capitalists make from the labor of their workers is exploitative, because the surplus value can be produced only by the worker and it belongs to the laborer. Marx did not condemn profit itself, but he argued that the profit should not become a private property of capitalists. He thought that capital, which was produced by all, should be owned by all. In other word, private citizens should not be allowed to monopolize the means of production and seize the surplus value. In capitalism, however, capitalist is “a villain, a parasite who lives by sucking the economic lifeblood of the proletariat, and must be erased from society” (Baradat, 1991, p. 160)."

    },
    "explanation": "Dialectical materialism is the scientific foundation of Marx’s theory. The roots of dialectical materialism lie in the dialectic method of Hegel, who developed a theory of history focusing on change. According to Hegel, the world moves toward a goal, which is predetermined by God. He called this goal as “idea” and believed that people could not understand, change or escape from it. The history for Hegel is the process of change brought on by a struggle that only ends when the idea is fulfilled. Until then, the existing state of affairs, or any “thesis” is to be challenged by a new idea that is known as the “antithesis” in his perspective. Then, a conflict occurs between the thesis and antithesis, which is called the “dialectic process”, and results in a “synthesis” that consists of all the good parts of both. The synthesis then becomes a new thesis, and the dialectic process continues as such. In short, history for Hegel was unavoidably progressive, today’s reality would become a part of a better tomorrow, and each new era would exceed and improve the former one. Marx accepted and adopted the dialectic as the essential logic of history. But, he did not accept the metaphysical assumptions of Hegel. Like Hegel, Marx also considered the dialectic as a means of accomplishing historical progress through struggle; yet he changed it since, for Marx, it was materialism which inspired the dialectic, not spiritualism. Marx claimed that the dialectic was a conflict among worldly interests, and ideas were the results of such conflict (Baradat, 1991, p. 152-4). According to Marx, class differences caused conflict among human beings. What ended a historical era and caused the rise of a new era so far has been the struggle between opposing social classes. Humans have passed through four historical stages, all of which had particular economic (the foundation) and political (superstructure) systems. These stages are the primitive communism, slavery (empire), feudalism and capitalism. The antithesis of every stage emerged within that stage itself. For example, private property emerged in the era of primitive communism and created social classes.\n As also understood from the information given, all of the statements related to dialectical materialism in the options are correct, so the correct answer is E."

    "explanation": "Recommended Revision\n<br/>Page 180\n<br/>Inw history, the real driving force of change is <strong>not only technology or economic systems as isolated institutions. But, it is </strong>organized social groups and class conflict (Cuff et al., 2013, p. 36).\n<br/>In history, the real driving force of change is <strong>not only technology or economic systems as isolated institutions, but also</strong> organized social groups and class conflict (Cuff et al., 2013, p. 36).<br/>According to Marx, there are two basic parts in every society, these are the substructure and the superstructure. The economic system is the foundation of the society. In other words, it is the substructure, or material base. The substructure is divided into two factors, the means of production and the relations of production. The means of production are the resources and technology that a society makes use of. Means of production include tools, machinery, factories, materials and land; and together with labor power, they constitute productive forces. The relations of production between social classes are determined by the affiliation between humans and the means of production. The ruling class in every society consists of people who own the property of the means of production. Therefore, in a pastoral animal breeding society, the owners of the most of the livestock is ruling class. In an agricultural society, the ruling class consist of people who own most of the land and agricultural implements such as the ploughs. In industrial society, the capitalist class, namely those who own the factories and productive machines, rule the society. The superstructure of the society is composed of all of the non-material institutions in the society such as religion, government, law, education, art, values, ideology and so forth. It is determined by the foundation of the society; and every institution it includes is arranged to suit the ruling class. In every society, the social institutions in the superstructure justify the economic system as well as the power inequality in society through values and norms. Institutions, such as laws, ideologies, education and religion, create and maintain sympathetic, positive attitudes towards the economic and the political system. In addition, in political regimes such as representative democracy, there is an illusion that masses have control over the governments. However, the governments are in fact led by the leading capitalists. Hence, the superstructure ensures the domination of the ruling class.\n As also understood from the information given, the statements related to the substructure and the superstructure in the options II, III, IV and V are correct, so the correct answer is E. The statement in the option I is not correct because of the fact that the economic system is the foundation of the society. In other words, it is the substructure, or material base, not the superstructure."

    "explanation": "Although there is a middle class, Marx considers that capitalism tends to condense the capital in the hands of fewer capitalists, to push the middle class towards being proletariat and transform every kind of labor into paid labor. This process is called the polarization of the classes. There are mainly three steps in this process:\n <ul> <li>First, because of the competition in the capitalist market, capitalists will increase the use of machinery in the factories. This will eliminate the skill differences among the workers, because in these factories, the only duty of a worker is to follow the instructions in order to make the machine work.</li> <li>Second, as the capital continues to accumulate in the hands of the capitalists, the capitalists will become richer and the workers will become poorer. Even if the wages of workers may rise and their living standards may become better, the gap between these two classes would not shrink because the wealth of the capitalists depends on the exploitation of the surplus value that the proletariat produce. In addition, the increased machine use in the factories would cause many workers to lose their jobs and become a part of the reserve army of the unemployed. Therefore, the poverty of the working class would perpetually intensify. This process is called pauperization.</li> <li>Third, because of the extreme competition -a fundamental trait of capitalism- and particularly of the monopolies, petit bourgeoisie (the owners of small businesses) will lose their properties (means of production) and become a part of proletariat.</li> </ul> Through these three ways, the social classes would gather at two sides; and two main classes would remain. This means that capitalism itself creates the masses that would overthrow it.\n As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is E. The statements in the options I, II, III and IV are related to the polarization of the classes according to the political theory of Marx. The statement in the option V is related to the three antecedents or preconditions for the revolution in relation to economic factors, social factors and the creation of class-consciousness for the proletariat."

In the summary section on the page 197, leftists (social anarchists) and rightist anarchists are mentioned. On the page 194 there is a sentence as follows: “The main difference between the social anarchists and the individualist anarchists is related to individual freedom.” Are the pacifists or the revolutionaries the social anarchists? Who are rightist anarchists? While reading these sentences, I face with difficulty in understanding.<br/>Pacifist anarchists have a lot of differences among themselves, but they share an important notion of pacifism. All of the pacifist anarchists believe that the use of violence is not a viable way for social change, violence and war are unjustifiable, indefensible and all changes should be made with peaceful means. However, they have different ideas about what these ways should be.\n The main difference between the social anarchists and the individualist anarchists is related to individual freedom. Social anarchists aspire for the elimination of the government because they were in belief that government limits the freedom of the people. They are not interested in the freedom of the individual in particular. This is because, according to them, individuals are interrelated and are responsible to each other to some degree. On the other hand, individualist anarchists reject any kind of obligation upon the individual, including this kind of a responsibility as a group norm. Indeed, they do not attain much value to the relationships of individuals with each other.\n As also understood from the information given, all of the statements in the options related to the prominent anarchists in the 19th century are correct, so the correct answer is E."

However, in this system, it would have been impossible to prevent inequalities that quite possibly would emerge because of humans’ unequal capacities, talents or conditions. On the other hand, if the private property was prevented, the incentive to work would be lost and society would face with a danger of falling into the extreme poverty. The answer is A."

Rawls in here considers the first principle, which guarantees basic political liberties (for example, freedom of speech, right to vote, freedom of association, and so forth) for everyone, having priority over the second principle, which arranges distributions in power and wealth in line with a meritocratic view and some egalitarian concerns.

It rejects the intervention to the spontaneous order of market that is assumed to work so as to distribute all desired and undesired goods perfectly just on its own. The main characteristic of just society is considered as the one in which everyone is equally entitled to the rights of acquisition, transfer and holding private properties.

It is usual to observe that the latter one, namely distributional or social justice and its ethical background, plays a prominent role in defining the content and scope of the former one, namely the criminal or judicial justice, although such a hierarchical positioning between these dimensions may not always be as effective as it is claimed. For example, the argument that everyone’s private property should be secured and anyone cannot seize other’s private property need to be first of all proposed, developed and ethically justified within the dimension of social justice. Following this, necessary legal arrangements to protect individuals’ private properties are proposed, developed and introduced. Without its philosophically ethical underpinnings are formed, any issue concerning legal arrangements within the scope criminal justice cannot be maintained. In other words, inviolableness of one’s private property in legal arrangements cannot be proposed, developed and socially sustained without an ethical and philosophical justification regarding why one’s private property is untouchable. This demonstrates the lexical priority of social or distributional justice over the criminal or judicial justice although such priority is not easily observable in all regulations that are amended by the ruling authority\n As also understood from the information given, the statements in the options I, III and IV demonstrate the lexical priority of social or distributional justice over the criminal or judicial justice, so the correct answer is D.

    "explanation": "Both in classical and contemporary ages, the idea of social justice is discussed in relation to various concepts such as rights, desert, merit, rule, covenant, consent, free-will, freedom, fairness, choice, well-being, poverty, inequality and so forth. The idea of justice that can be traced back to the ancient world is seen as a virtue of man and society in ancient Greek philosophy (Adelson, 1995, p. 29; Jackson, 1986, p. 8). Such an understanding of justice can easily be observed in the Republic, a well-known work of Plato, in which the central issue is “justice” discussed in relation to the concept of “virtue”. In some of the very first dialogues between the fictional characters, justice is considered as a virtue and discussed in relation to actions of individuals in this work of Plato. In the dialogues that are mostly configured in a form of Socratic method of reciprocal talks, justice is granted as one of the most appreciated excellences of human beings and identified as the virtue of individual (Forde, 1997, p. 659; Demos, 1964, p. 396). Plato’s attempt is, however, to reach a societal understanding of justice through these dialogues.\n According to Plato, each group and individual play roles to meet the needs of the whole (Campbell, 2010, p. 7) in a well-ordered society that is a perfectly arranged society, where all institutions and groups are organised to perform a particular function. Such an understanding of society, where individuals and societal organisations are given roles to satisfy particular duties and actions can in fact be considered as an early reference to what we call in modern societies as “division of labour”. To justify why human beings are in need of living together in a well-ordered society, where every one of them is assigned with certain responsibilities to perform a particular action in line with their skills, two facts are reminded. The first one is that any individual cannot keep living on her own in a world where quite a number of natural and man-made dangers exist. The second one is that life is less difficult, more comfortable and prosperous by living together as a society.\n As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is E.

    "explanation": "As a philosopher who paved the way heading towards one of the most influential theories of social justice, namely utilitarianism, David Hume is today given a prominent place in not only discussions regarding social justice, but quite a number of different subjects too. According to Hume, justice is a device to ensure the sustainability of social order.\n It can be said that Bentham and Mill gained a more systematic form to the initial perspective of Hume who considered the just and good action in relation to its possibility of leading to increase the public utility. The question of how the utility should be assessed is answered through an emphasis on the happiness in the utilitarian account. This means that justness of an action, a decision, or a policy is evaluated to the extent of happiness that it yields for the society. In other words, in utilitarian account of justice, utility is translated into the form of happiness and social justice is evaluated according to the happiness of society. Therefore, it can be said that increasing overall public utility is considered as increasing public happiness in the utilitarian account. In line with such a perspective that considers utility as happiness, utilitarian model of social justice of Bentham and Mill advocates the proposition of “the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people” (Campbell, 2010, p. 116). This demonstrates its majoritarian characteristics. In other words, instead of focusing on every individual’s level of happiness, it advocates to focus on overall happiness of society. This, as can be seen as a maximalist approach that claims “rules of justice have to lie in the way that they promote the greatest possible quantity of happiness” (Ryan, 1993, p. 12). Bentham, for example, argues that “approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever, according to the tendency which it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question: or, what is the same thing in other words, to promote or to oppose that happiness (Bentham, 2005 [1789], p. 11-12). In this context, utilitarianism considers justice in accordance with the aggregative interest of the society. Hence, it is considered as aggregative theory of justice (Miller, 1976, p. 32).\n According to the utilitarian approach to the idea of social justice, a just society is associated with the perspective that the common interest of the society is taken as the prevailing criteria in decision, actions, or policies of the ruling authority.\n The modern form of utilitarian logic, in essence, does not much differ from its classical definition that is mostly discussed in line with Bentham and Mill’s works. The focal point of justice, in other words, the essence of justice in the contemporary utilitarian perspective is also the aggregate utility.\n As also understood from the information given, all of the statements related to utilitarianism in the options are correct, so the correct answer is E."

It does so by drawing on some hypothetical devices of impartiality that Rawls terms as the “original position” (Rawls, 2003, pp. 15-9) and the “veil of ignorance” (ibid. 118-23).\n One of the distinctive characteristics of the Rawlsian approach to social justice is associated with its institutional perspective. In Rawls’ approach, justice is considered as a “virtue of institutions” (Rawls, 2005 [1971], p. 586) whilst the libertarian view considers it as “virtue of individuals” with the purpose of defining just action in the realm of individual’s rational choice.

    "explanation": "Rawls’ idea of justice as fairness is a comprehensive political idea of justice that has taken a great interest from quite a number of political scientists in our era. Among others, Amartya Sen, a Nobel laureate economist and philosopher, also discussed on the Rawlsian idea of justice extensively and pointed out several criticisms.\n First of all, Sen criticizes Rawls with giving priority to the liberal rights over the economic ones. Sen asks, “why should we regard hunger, starvation and medical neglect to be invariably less important than the violation of any kind of personal liberty?” (Sen, 2009, p. 65). He continues, “it is indeed possible to accept that liberty must have some kind of priority, but total unrestrained priority is almost certainly an overkill” (Ibid). Second, Sen points out that the Rawlsian model of social justice is a transcendental one (Sen, 2009, pp. 8-10; 2008, pp. 336-7) that makes it difficult to apply on the face of everyday problems of injustice. Third, he also criticizes Rawls’ focus on the means of good living instead of on the “actual living that people manage to achieve” (Sen, 1999, p. 73; see also Sen, 1992, p. 84). This criticism is in fact the primary criticism of Sen to Rawls.\n Sen claims that Rawls’ model is substantially sensitive to the inter-end variation in line with pluralistic liberal conception of justice, yet it falls short of taking inter-individual variation into account (Sen, 1992, pp. 85-6).\n Based on the criticisms above, Sen proposes a different analytical framework to assess social justice. This framework is known as the capability approach in the literature. Suggesting that the individuals’ capability, or freedom, should be the basis of assessment regarding justice, Sen provides a promising way to overcome the problem that is related to people’s differentiated social and personal characteristics leading to inequalities in achieving a good life. Sen’s capability approach to justice claims that the primary objective of social arrangements should be based on the expansion of people’s capabilities or their substantive freedoms to achieve valuable beings and doings that they attain value (Alkire and Deneulin, 2009, p. 31; Alkire, 2005, p. 122; Alkire, 2008, p. 28).\n As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is E.

These conversion factors can be defined as the entities to help or hinder the translation of commodities into functionings (Grasso, 2002, p. 5). According to Sen, personal heterogeneities, environmental diversities, variations in social climate, differences in relational perspectives and distribution within the family can be seen five primary sources of human diversity which influence people’s ability to convert their holdings into something valuable for them (Sen, 1999, pp. 70-1; 2009, pp. 255-7).\n As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is E.

    "explanation": "It may not be wrong to stress that Nancy Fraser and Axel Honneth are developers of the one of the most influential ideas towards justice in 21st century even though this is a quite new idea in comparison to other theories of justice discussed above. Fraser and Honneth share the same claim that an adequate understanding of justice should include both redistribution of wealth and recognition of different identities. They consider that the idea of justice focusing on only economic welfare is reductionist since there has been an increasing demand for recognition of different identities such as ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious groups, and so forth. Although they both agree that recognition and redistribution are indispensable parts of social justice, Honneth gives a fundamental emphasis to recognition and treating redistribution as a derivative subject, while Fraser perceives both recognition and redistribution as co-fundamental subjects which do not have priority over each other (Fraser and Honneth, 2003, p. 3). Fraser’s approach is based on the concept of “bivalent collectivity”. Drawing on this concept, she refers to people who suffer from both unjust socioeconomic distribution and cultural misrecognition. We can see a sort of Weberian interpretation in Fraser. Honneth constructs his perspective based on the identity model of Hegel.\n As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is E.

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "options": {
      "A": "Through well-being",
      "B": "Through happiness",
      "C": "Through freedom",
      "D": "Through entitlements",
      "E": "Through institutional rights"
    },
    "explanation": "It can be said that Bentham and Mill gained a more systematic form to the initial perspective of Hume who considered the just and good action in relation to its possibility of leading to increase the public utility. The question of how the utility should be assessed is answered through an emphasis on the happiness in the utilitarian account. This means that justness of an action, a decision, or a policy is evaluated to the extent of happiness that it yields for the society."

    },
    "explanation": "Robert Nozick is frequently pointed out as the leading figure of the contemporary libertarian model of social justice. Nozick’s theory of entitlement primarily focuses on individuals’ holding of private properties and is established on three principles as follows:\n * If a person acquires a holding in accordance with justice, then this person is entitled to this holding.\n * If a holding transferred to a person from someone else entitled this holding before and, thus, acquired by this person in accordance with justice, then this person is entitled to this holding.\n * Anyone is entitled to a holding unless the implications of principle one and two."

      "E": "Robert Nozick"
    },
    "explanation": "One of the distinctive characteristics of the Rawlsian approach to social justice is associated with its institutional perspective. In Rawls’ approach, justice is considered as a “virtue of institutions” whilst the libertarian view considers it as “virtue of individuals” with the purpose of defining just action in the realm of individual’s rational choice"

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "options": {
      "A": "Rawls takes primary goods as the embodiment of advantage",
      "B": "Rawls' focus on happiness ignores distorted characteristic of subjective well-being",
      "C": "Rawls' proposal to focus on desire-satisfaction is flawed due to cultural aspects of desire-satisfaction",
      "D": "Rawls pays a huge attention o ends of good living, but not on the means of good living",
      "E": "Rawls' primary aim should not be increasing public welfare since it ignores individuals' liberty"
    },
    "explanation": "Sen criticizes Rawls’ focus on the means of good living instead of on the “actual living that people manage to achieve”. This criticism is in fact the primary criticism of Sen to Rawls. Sen reminds the distinction between the means and ends of good living. He stresses that “Rawls takes primary goods as the embodiment of advantage”. In other words, Rawls presupposes that equal holdings of primary goods yield equal advantage in achieving a good life."

      "B": "Peter Townsend",
      "C": "Amartya Sen",
      "D": "Ronald Dworkin",
      "E": "Amartya Sen"
    },
    "explanation": "It may not be wrong to stress that Nancy Fraser and Axel Honneth are developers of the one of the most influential ideas towards justice in 21st century even though this is a quiet new idea in comparison to other theories of justice discussed above. Fraser and Honneth share the same claim that an adequate understanding of justice should include both redistribution of wealth and recognition of different identities. They consider that the idea of justice focusing on only economic welfare is reductionist since there has been an increasing demand for recognition of different identities such as ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious groups, and so forth. Although they both agree that recognition and redistribution are indispensable parts of social justice, Honneth gives a fundamental emphasis to recognition and treating redistribution as a derivative subject, while Fraser perceives both recognition and redistribution as co-fundamental subjects which do not have priority over each other."
