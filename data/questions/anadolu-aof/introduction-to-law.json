As Professor Weinreb observes: “The reasoning of a doctor or an engineer is readily and in the normal course put to the test.

Criminal prohibitions must determine the prohibited conduct, they must be definite (the principle of certainty)<br/>3. Acts cannot be punished retroactively. (the principle of non retroactivity) The penalty and any ancillary measures shall be determined by the law which is in force at the time of the act. If the penalty is amended during the commission of the act, the law in force at the time the act is completed shall be applied. If the law in force at the time of the completion of the act is amended before judgment, the most lenient law shall be applied. A law intended to be in force only for a determinate time shall be continued to be applied to acts committed while it was in force even after it ceases to be in force, unless otherwise provided by law.<br/>4. The statutory prohibition cannot be extended by analogy to conduct not covered by the ordinary meaning of the words used. (the principle of the interdiction of analogy). The ECHR, with its Article 7, defines the principle as ‘No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offense on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offense under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offense was committed.’"

Common examples of torts include wrongful death, intentional or negligent infliction of personal injury, wrongful destruction of property, trespass, and defamation of character.<br/>A crime normally entails intentional conduct; thus, a driver whose car accidentally hits and kills another person would not necessarily be guilty of a crime, depending on the circumstances."

The crime of adultery damaged not only the institution of family, but also the public order.<br/>• In 1996, the Turkish Constitutional Court decided that adultery would no longer<br/>constitute a criminal offense for men, while Article 441 regarding the woman adultery<br/>remained valid.<br/>• In 1999, Article 441 of the TPC that required imprisonment for women convicted of adultery was repealed.<br/>• From this date on, adultery would no longer constitute a criminal offense, while remaining as a cause of action for divorce under Article 161 of theTurkish Civil Code."

    "explanation": "Criminal liability of an actor can only be discussed if he/she acted of his/her own free will. The defense of constraint, sometimes known as duress, applies when the defendant had no choice but to commit the offense. This traditional defense of duress covers situations where the defendant has been forced by another to break the law under a direct threat of death or serious personal injury to himself/herself or someone else85. The perpetrator who acted under the influence of a force or a constraint that he/she could not resist does not have criminal liability. The correct answer is E."

On the basis of these arguments, it is said that theories of punishment regarding the purposes of criminal law, are divided into <strong>absolute and relative</strong> theories.

The Latin for ‘guilty mind’, ‘mens rea’ refers to the notion according to which a court should not find a person guilty of a crime unless he/she has a blameworthy state of mind.

When there is no corpse, this situation is not regarded as death. At this point, there are two important presumptions under which legally the person is also considered to be dead though there is no corpse present. <br/>The two important presumptions which death is presumed are presumption of death and<br/>presumption of absence. According to this provision, the death of a person is deemed proven, even if no one has seen the corpse, if that person has disappeared in circumstances in which his death may be considered certain. The result of death presumption is just like normal death. There is no need for a special court decision.<br/>In declaration of absence there are two different situations. In the first case, it is highly probable that a person is dead because he or she has disappeared in extremely life-threatening circumstances. In that case the next of kin has to wait for one year and then apply to the court.<br/>In the second case, a person has been missing for a lengthy period of time without any sign<br/>of life.

If a person gets married<br/>before the completion of 18 years of age in the mentioned circumstances, this would acquire majority. The second way is the court decision. A minor who has completed his/her 15 years of age, may upon his/her application and with the consent of his/her parents, be declared by the court to be of full age. But to grant this decision, there should be a valid ground for this application.<br/>Persons who have discretion are able to make fair judgements, so that they can act rationally. According to article 13 of the Civil Code, a person is capable of making fair judgements if he or she<br/>does not lack the capacity to act rationally by virtue of being under age or because of a mental disability, mental disorder, intoxication or similar circumstances. <br/>There are some grounds in which a person may be interdicted. They are named in CC art. 404- 408 as mental disability, mental disorder, habitual drunkenness, habitual gambling, one year or more imprisonment. In these situations a person is interdicted."

This action should be brought within 6 months.<br/>2- Plots against life, grave assaults/insults: A plot against life is attempt by one spouse to murder the other spouse. Grave assaults<br/>are threats or attempts to do bodily harm to the other spouse, by force or violence. Grave insults are actions of humiliation by one spouse to the other spouse. The spouse may again bring an action for divorce in six months time he/she learns about this act and in five years this act is committed. If the spouse forgives the one who has committed such an act, then this spouse shall not have a right to bring an action for divorce.<br/>3- Crime and dishonorable life: The conviction of a spouse for a humiliating crime or the dishonorable conducts of one of the spouses, like habitual drunkenness or habitual gambling, are grounds for divorce. But to bring an action for divorce, it should not be expected for the other spouse to continue living with this spouse any more.<br/>4- Desertion: If one of the spouses leaves the marital domicile in order not to fulfill his/her marital duties or does not return to the marital domicile without a just ground and if this period at least six months, the remaining spouse may bring an action for<br/>divorce. During this six month period, the remaining spouse should ask either the judge or the notary to draw a notice and invite his/her spouse back home and remind him/her about the results of his/her not returning. <br/>5- Mental illness: If one of the spouses becomes mentally ill and life becomes for this reason unbearable to the other spouse, the healthy spouse may bring an action for divorce, on the condition that this illness is proved to be incurable by a medical report."

    },
    "explanation": "An obligation has three elements:<br/>Creditor: Creditor is the party who is entitled to request the consideration. In a donation contract, the parties are named as the donor and the donee. Donee is the creditor. Whereas in a sales contract, the parties are named as the seller and the buyer and both of them are creditors, since sales contract is a contract in which both of the parties are under a burden of a consideration. The “seller” is under the liability of delivering the sold goods to buyer, the “buyer” is liable to pay agreed price to seller, in return.<br/>Debtor: Debtor is the party who is bound to perform a certain act given as consideration. In a donation contract, the donor is the debtor, whereas in a sales contract both the seller and buyer are debtors.<br/>Consideration: Consideration is an act, which the debtor is obliged to perform as the content of her obligation. It may be an act of giving something, like in sales contracts, giving the good and giving the payment in return. It may be an act of doing something, like in employment contract-employees cleaning the building, or it may be an act of refraining from doing something, like in an agreement of restraint of trade.<br/>Thus, in a sales contract, both the buyer and the seller are the creditors and also the debtors."

Since these are limited in number, the parties do not have any discretion to freely create new types of legal unions which have not been set forth in the Civil Code or apply the consequences of marriage to other civil unions by analogy.<br/>The correct answer is B."

People normally reach majority at the end of 18 years, but a person at the age of 17 can get married with the permission of the parents. Furthermore, marriage between close relatives is prohibited, and <u>monogamy</u> is one of the essential principles of marriage.<br/>As required in any legal transaction, the <u>declaration of intention</u> by the parties is a must in marriage. According to the Turkish Civil Code, the man and the woman must express orally their will to get married in front of an official authorized (civil registrar).<br/>Consent of parents is not required to get married unless one of the partners is not younger than 18 years of age.<br/>The correct answer is D."

    },
    "explanation": "A contract is a legal transaction concluded by a mutual exchange of assents of two or more persons. Therefore, for the formation of a contract there is a need for two mutually declared intentions - offer and acceptance. An offer is a declaration of intention by one party, known as the offeror, whereby he expresses his willingness to enter into a contract. An offer, until it is terminated, gives the offeree a continuing power to create a contract by declaring an acceptance. An acceptance is a declaration of intention to agree to the terms of the offer. If all its elements are complete, a contract takes effect at the moment it is concluded. <br/>The offeror does not have to set a time limit. If no time limit is set, then the Code of Obligations makes a distinction between the parties who are present and who are absent. Where an offer is made in the offeree’s presence and no time limit for acceptance is set, it is no longer binding on the offeror unless the offeree accepts it immediately. Offers declared by telephone, computer or other communication tools, on the condition that the parties understand and respond simultaneously, are considered to be made in the offeree’s presence. Thus, physical presence is not required for a contractual offer.<br/>The correct answer is C."
