    "explanation": "If your answer is incorrect, please refer to Chapter 3 in your textbook.<br/>The example produced with the constraints in the question body have actually happened in the past. When people used two main ingredients (potatoes and meat pieces) to prepare meal, their response to a price increase in potatoes was an increased demand towards potatoes, making its demand curve positively sloped. Note that this happened due to income effect being greater than the substitution effect. In other words, people had to use more potatoes in their meal to keep their stomach full, as it was much cheaper compared to meat.<br/>Giffen good is a type of good whose demand curve slopes upward because the good is inferior and the positive income effect outweighs the negative substitution effect in response to a price change."

For example, one firm can own the entire supply of any critical input or raw material used in the production of an output which grants the monopoly position to this firm in that market. If output cannot be produced without this input, then no other firm can enter into the market and produce it. Secondly, technological knowledge possessed formally or informally builds an entry barrier. Some outputs may require very high technical expertise. If only one firm keeps this expertise, this firm will be the only producer of this output. Also, intellectual property rights bestow a firm to be the sole owner of technological knowledge used in the production process, i.e., patents, know-how, copyrights, etc. Sometimes, the entry barrier arises naturally. If there is an opportunity for huge cost advantages in large scales in any industry, then one firm can capture the entire market naturally due to this scale of economy. In some cases, managers in public administrations endow some firms with the authority of producing and selling certain products due to feasibility reasons. For example, a water distribution network is run by municipalities. Otherwise, the water network would be too complicated and unproductive."

Thus, when n-1 markets in the model are in equilibrium, the nth market will also have to be in equilibrium."

At this point, consumers maximize their utility subject to their budget constraint. Since this is also the output mix that the producers would choose to supply, product markets clear. At this point, marginal rate of substitution (MRS) of C<sub>X</sub> for C<sub>Y</sub> in consumption is equal to the marginal rate of product transformation (MRPT), or the marginal rate of transformation (MRT), along the PPT. Mathematically, the MRS is negative of the slope of the highest social indifference curve that the society can reach, whereas the RPT is negative of the slope of PPT. Since E is a point of tangency between these two curves, their slopes must be equal at that point. Thus, the amount of Y that the consumers are willing to give up to get one more unit of X (dC<sub>Y</sub> /dC<sub>X</sub>) is the same as the amount of Y that the producers are willing to give up to produce one more unit of X (d<sub>Y</sub> /d<sub>X</sub>) at this point.
