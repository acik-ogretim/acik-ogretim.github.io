The first group of assets are called current assets whereas the latter is called non-current assets (long-term assets). Non-current assets are the assets that are acquired to use in the operations of the business for several years. Besides these assets, receivables that have due dates of more than one year will also be reported under non-current assets.

Secondly, it must be controlled by the business and lastly the transaction that caused future benefit and control must occur in the past. The control property here indicates that an economic resource must be fully under control of a business but other parties don’t have a right of providing benefit from it.

    "explanation": "Assets are defined as the economic resources acquired by the business in order to benefit from them in the future. In fact, there is an expectation for the businesses to use the assets in their operations. Some of these assets can be converted into cash, sold, collected and consumed within one year or operation cycle which is shorter but some of the assets will be used in operations for more than a year. The first group of assets are called current assets whereas the latter is called non-current assets (long-term assets). Non-current assets are the assets that are acquired to use in the operations of the business for several years. Besides these assets, receivables that have due dates of more than one year will also be reported under non-current assets. Property, Plant and Equipment generally hold the largest portion in noncurrent assets. As can also be understood from the information given, “The assets that will be used in operations for more than a year.” and “Receivables that have due dates of more than one year” can be recognized as non-current assets, so the correct answer is C.<br/>“The assets that can be converted into cash, sold, collected and consumed within one year or operation cycle which is shorter” are called currents assets. “A factory building rented to use in the operations.” can not be reported under assets. When the business rents a building to use in the operations, it cannot be recognized as an asset because the business doesn’t have full control on building. For example, the business cannot sell the building to anyone.. But there is one exception at this point. Leasing transactions provides companies use the property, plant and equipment assets within a rental agreement. At the end of the agreement the user company called as “lessee” takes over the property of the asset from the owner (lessor) company. During the rental period, lessee makes the rental payments. Though a leasing transaction seems as if it is a rental transaction, because the ownership of the asset is handed over to the user company, according to the substance over legal form concept of accounting. The legal form of this transaction is a rental transaction but as the asset is going to be taken over from the owner at the end of the rental agreement, economic substance of the transaction steps forward and the economic resource acquired by a leasing transaction recognized as an asset."

Otherwise, they would either be reported under merchandise inventory or reported as an expense.</li> <li>They are in long-term in nature and usually depreciated: Property, plant and equipment assets provide economic benefit for several years. This means that within the revenue the company earned these assets have contributions. In other words, by using these assets their benefits are consumed. As you remember, the matching principle indicates that the revenues of a period must be matched with the expenses of the same period for calculating the profit/loss of the period. So the cost of the long-lived assets should be divided into their useful lives. This allocation of a long-lived asset’s cost over its useful life is called depreciation.

    "explanation": "The decision to acquire a long-term asset is a complex process. The historical cost principle requires that companies record property, plant and equipment assets at their actual cost. So, what is cost? Cost consists of all expenditures necessary to acquire the asset and make it ready for its intended use.4 According to the historical cost principle, cost is the cash or cash equivalent price of obtaining the asset and bringing it to the location and condition necessary for its intended use5. So, pay attention to the expression “bringing it to the location and condition necessary for its intended use”. This means that the cost of the property, plant, and equipment assets does not only consist of the purchase price of the asset. Added to the purchase price cash or cash equivalent prices for transferring, installment, assembling, insurance during transfer, permits, etc. must be included. As can also be understood from the information given, the correct answer is D. The statements “Cost is the cash or cash equivalent price of obtaining the asset and bringing it to the location and condition necessary for its intended use.”, “The cost of the property, plant, and equipment assets does not only consist of the purchase price of the asset.” and “Added to the purchase price cash or cash equivalent prices for transferring, installment, assembling, insurance during transfer, permits, etc. must be included.” are correct.

Company B makes an expenditure for 25,000 TL for the machine in order to increase the production capacity of the machine.

Therefore, Machinery and Equipment account is debited in this transaction. Company C pays 5,000 TL for the annual maintenance of the machine. In this transaction, the expenditure does neither extend the useful life of the machine nor increases the capacity or productivity. So, these kinds of expenditures will not be added to the cost of the machine. They will be recorded as period expense. To shorten the distance between suppliers, Company D decides to move the factory to Organized Industrial Zone and pays 150,000 TL for disassembling and reassembling of the machines and 100.000 TL. for the transportation. Even though the expenditures are made for the assets to bring them to their intended uses, they will be recorded as period expenses; because this criterion is applied just for the initial recognition of the assets.

    "explanation": "Property, Plant and Equipment assets remain on the business’s accounting books until they are disposed of. Companies dispose of property, plant and equipment assets which are no longer useful for the company. Eventually, a long-lived asset wears out or becomes obsolete. When plant assets are no longer useful because they have physically deteriorated or become obsolete, a company can dispose them by discarding, selling them for cash, or exchanging them for a new long-lived asset. The disposal of property, plant and equipment assets can take one of three forms:<br/><ul> <li>Discard (retire) the long-lived asset.</li> <li>Sell the long-lived asset for cash.</li> <li>Exchange the long-lived asset for another long-lived asset.</li> </ul> Discarding (retiring) of property, plant and equipment assets involve disposing of the asset for no cash. If an asset is disposed of when it is fully depreciated and has no residual value, then the original cost and accumulated depreciation of the long-lived asset are simply written off the accounting books. There is no need to bring the depreciation up to date because the asset is already fully depreciated. In addition, no gain or loss is recognized because no cash was received or paid. A loss is recognized if a company retires a long-lived asset before it is fully depreciated and no cash is received for residual or salvage value. If a long-lived asset is still being used, its cost and accumulated depreciation should remain in the ledger even if the asset is fully depreciated until the company discard the asset. The company may continue to report it on balance sheet even though no additional depreciation expense is recorded.<br/>Accounting for the sale of a long-lived asset is essentially the same as accounting for its discarding except that cash is received in the exchange. In a disposal by sale for cash, the company compares the book value of the asset with the cash received from the sale. If the cash received from the sale exceed the book value of the long-lived asset, a gain on disposal occurs. If the cash received from the sale is less than the book value of the long-lived asset sold, a loss on disposal occurs.<br/>If exchanges have commercial substance (which is when there is a change in cash flow resulting from the transaction), the parties should recognize a gain or loss on the exchange. The old asset will be removed from the accounting books, and the new asset will be recorded at its market value. Most of the exchanges have commercial substance (even when similar assets are exchanged).<br/>As can also be understood from the information given, all the options are the forms of the disposal of property, plant and equipment assets, so the correct answer is E."

    "explanation": "Whenever a good or service is delivered, Value Added Tax (VAT) occurs. VAT is a kind of sales tax. The tax amount is calculated from the revenue (not income as in income tax) by using VAT rates on the delivered product or service. In a sales transaction, the seller receives an amount including both the sales price and VAT. VAT is not included in revenue because the seller collects the value added tax from customers on behalf of the government. On the other hand, the seller also pays VAT to the suppliers while purchasing goods. When the goods and services are delivered, the amount of tax is recorded as VAT received, and in cases of purchases, it is VAT paid account that the amount is recorded in. At the end of each fiscal year, these two accounts on VAT are considered. If VAT received exceeds the VAT paid, this means the seller company has collected more than what it has already paid to government as VAT. Then at year-end, a liability account should be recorded: VAT Payable. Company has to pay this amount to tax office. In opposite case, where VAT paid is more than VAT received, this means that the company has paid more tax. Then, it collected from customers on behalf of government. The excess amount is recorded in an asset account; VAT Deductible. This amount represents a tax receivable from government and is carried forward to the next year in order to be deducted from VAT tax liability."

      "D": "“Unearned revenue” refers to future revenues that are not collected but delivered.",
      "E": "All expenses should be recorded in the periods they incur; so that the performance of the company can be assessed accurately"
    },
    "explanation": "Liability” is defined as the present obligation of a company arising from past events and fulfillment of which causes outflow of economic benefits in terms of payments of cash, transfer of assets or rendering of services. From another perspective, with a very basic level definition, liability represents the part of financing that a company provides from resources other than claims of its equity owners. Depending on their maturities, liabilities are classified as “current liabilities” and “non-current liabilities”. The term “current” means “in the same period”, which stands for either “the same 12-months period” or “the same operating cycle”, whichever is longer. If it takes more than 12-months after the purchase of raw materials to produce and sell products and collect the receivables in return, this means that the operating cycle is more than 12 months for that company. In other words, the time needed by the company to provide funds from its operations and fulfill its liabilities is more than 12 months; thus, the term “current” proxies for the operating cycle. All expenses should be recorded in the periods they incur; so that the performance of the company can be assessed accurately, as its income statement covers all revenues and expenses for that period. Recognition of expenses do not require a cash outflow. Therefore, expenses are recognized in income statement even if they are not paid yet. When an expense incurs but the payment will be made in other periods, companies should also record a liability to be settled in future periods. That liability is called “accrued expenses”. Completely opposite situation, in which the company collects cash in advance but the goods or service will be delivered in other periods, also required the company to recognize a liability. However, this time the name of liability is “unearned revenue”. In short, the term “accrual” refers to expenses that are incurred but unpaid, while “unearned revenue” refers to future revenues that are collected but not delivered yet.The correct answer is D."

    },
    "explanation": "It is vitally important for a company to pay its current liabilities. What is called “current” is either the benefits to be received, or obligations to be met in one-year period. Combining these two definitions, companies care about the ability of current assets to meet current liabilities. If the current assets cannot match current liabilities, companies will have to either convert their non-current assets, which are usually used in providing capacity for operations, into current assets (in most cases cash) or will have to extend the maturities to longer terms with an additional amount of interest. Therefore, companies operating with too much share of current liability in total financing is usually accepted as too much risky to either invest or lend. On the other hand, if the company finances its operations mostly by using long-term financing options, the cost of financing will incur more compared to short-term financing, in terms of either interest or dividends.

    "explanation": "Whenever a good or service is delivered, Value Added Tax (VAT) occurs. VAT is a kind of sales tax. The tax amount is calculated from the revenue (not income as in income tax) by using VAT rates on the delivered product or service. In a sales transaction, the seller receives an amount including both the sales price and VAT. VAT is not included in revenue because the seller collects the value added tax from customers on behalf of the government. On the other hand, the seller also pays VAT to the suppliers while purchasing goods. When the goods and services are delivered, the amount of tax is recorded as VAT received, and in cases of purchases, it is VAT paid account that the amount is recorded in. At the end of each fiscal year, these two accounts on VAT are considered. If VAT received exceeds the VAT paid, this means the seller company has collected more than what it has already paid to government as VAT. Then at year-end, a liability account should be recorded: VAT Payable. Company has to pay this amount to tax office. In opposite case, where VAT paid is more than VAT received, this means that the company has paid more tax. Then, it collected from customers on behalf of government. The excess amount is recorded in an asset account; VAT Deductible. This amount represents a tax receivable from government and is carried forward to the next year in order to be deducted from VAT tax liability.The correct answer is A."

Amortization of a premium decreases bond interest expense.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is E. All of the statements related to amortization of bond discounts and premiums in the options are correct."

Also, the government and related regulators design more regulations and try to monitor corporations to protect shareholders’ and creditors’ claims. Another characteristic is the transferability of the shares. This characteristic is essential for shareholders since it is flexible. They can transfer corporation’s shares to another one. The cancellation of the corporation does not depend on the death of any shareholder or their choices to cancel it. In other words, the corporation is a permanent organization. The transfer of the shares, anyone’s death or withdrawal do not put an end to the corporation. Another distinguishing difference of a corporation is about taxation. Corporations are taxable entities.
