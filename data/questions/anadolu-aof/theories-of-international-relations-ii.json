As expressed by Cynthia Weber, the sovereign state shouldnot be understood as it was a priori presence; as opposed to traditional belief, the state is an ‘ontological effect of practices which are performatively enacted’. In other words, ‘<em>sovereign nation-states are not pre-given subjects but subjects in process”</em>. There is no existence of subject/state prior to the political practice. Sovereign states are continuously rebuilt through historical and political practices. It acquires an identity hereby with these actions. More clearly the state’s existence/identity is an effect of performativity that is constructed with discursive practise about foreign and domestic policies, security and defence strategies, or being a member of any international organization."

      "E": "It is an institution."

    "explanation": "The Problem of Power and Knowledge<br/>Michel Foucault approached the issue of power with different perspective from the traditional theories. In traditional approaches, power is considered to be something that can be possessed: individuals or states have power but some have more than others. For example liberal theory sees power as something that is established by a social contract. According to Marxism, power is a function of class domination that rests on the control of economic factors. Foucault conceptualized the traditional power as ‘<strong>juridico-discursive</strong>” where power comes from above, from a sovereign. He suggests a new way of thinking about power. According to Foucault, “<em>power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society.” </em>What is alluded to here is that power should not be seen as something that preexisting entities possess but as something generated in relationships. Therefore, according to Foucault, there is no power, but there are power relations."

    "explanation": "The Problem of Power and Knowledge<br/>Foucault was also interested in the analysis of <strong>discourse </strong>that relied on power and knowledge relations throughout his career. For Foucault, discourse cannot be inconceivable separated from the epistemes of the historical period in which it arises. Discourse, is an instrument of constituting knowledge, together with the social practice and power relations. On the one hand, discourse is created and perpetuated by the power; on the other hand, power is produced and transmitted by discourse. As expressed by Foucault, discourses constitute the reality, what can be thought and said about the world. Discourse as defined by Foucault, is the whole of the practices that construct the objects it speaks on or creates its own truth. So, according to Foucault there is no universal reality or truth as in poststructuralist thought. He asserts that meaning, truth and morality are created through discourse."

In other words, poststructuralism has problems with restrictive assumptions like the nature of international system which is anarchic and, restricts the actions of sovereign nation states. At first sight, these characterisations are generally accounted with the doctrine of realism or neorealism.

    "explanation": "Jacques Derrida indicates that when it comes to discourse, not only speech is necessary to come to mind but should also be contained in writing. To poststructuralists, language and discourse are quite important: object, subject, states, material structures etc. are constructed through the language. Unlike positivist claims, language is not a tool that is used for registration of data. Discourses are not only constative but are also performative. So you do/constitute something while you say something. For instance, sovereign states are constructed by discoursive practices, such as security discourse, immigration policies, policymakers’ discourse about national interest, economic invesment, threat, danger or existence of foreigners in their countries etc. Hence, in poststructuralist thought, discourse not only describes the world but also constructs it.

In other words, Foucault designed archaeology as a method of analysis that aims to unearth intellectual structures and historical a priori underlying different methods, concepts and theories of an idea and thought that dominates a particular period. As can be understood from the definition given, the correct answer is A. The information related to other concepts given in the other answer choices are as follows:<br/>Foucault conceptualized the traditional power as ‘juridico-discursive” where power comes from above, from a sovereign.<br/>The double reading method was included to literature as a deconstruction style by Derrida. The aim here is to understand the story of the construction of the identity of a discourse, a text or any other social institution. The first reading tells in accordance with original by using its own assumptions of the dominant discourse. In other words, it tries to show how dominated reinterpretation provides self-integrity or continuity of the discourse or institution. The main point here is the second reading. It tries to expose the inner contradictions and how they are unsuccesfully closed and displaced by exerting pressure on the discourse or weaknesses of the institution.<br/>Deconstruction is the best-known and noteworthy form of poststructural criticism.

    },
    "explanation": "Archaeology was a crucial method for Foucault but this metodology could not convincingly explain the causes of discontinuities which meant that objects or phenomena were not perceived, classified, or depicted in the same way in the transition from a historical period to another. He also noted that archaealogy’s limitations in his foreword to the English translation of The Order of Things. That’s why the philosopher worked on a new methodology called “genealogy” in Discipline and Punish for remedying this deficiency. The point that should be considered here is not the fact that genealogy is a deviation from archeology but rather is the purpose of completing it. Genealogy deals with the imposition of present on the past. This metodology focuses on the complex relationship between discourse and power, and tries to show that history is shaped within the framework of these relations and does not have continuity.<br/>It should be underlined that the genealogy does not only consist of collecting certain data from the history. Here, the primary aim is to reveal the formations of them and the power-knowledge relations in their backgrounds by -in the words of Derrida- deconstructing the established understanding and norms. Thus, Foucault tries to demonstrate that words, language, or discourse (utterances/statements and texts) are not as innocent as those attempted to show, and are shaped within the framework of current power/ knowledge and power relations. In a sense, by deconstructing social relations, it aims to show that there are multiple perspectives by freeing them from the general narratives/commandments that have a heap of historical domination. The way to do this is to create a counter memory. As can be understood from the information given, the correct answer is E."

In fact, as stated by Robert Cox, one of the prominent names of Frankfurt School, “<em>theory is always for someone and for some purpose”</em>. For this reason they reject the possibility of value-free social analysis. In other words, theoretical knowledge is not independent from the values, thoughts and ideological beliefs of the theorist."

Discourse, is an instrument of constituting knowledge, together with the social practice and power relations. On the one hand, discourse is created and perpetuated by the power; on the other hand, power is produced and transmitted by discourse. As expressed by Foucault, discourses constitute the reality, what can be thought and said about the world. Discourse as defined by Foucault, is the whole of the practices that construct the objects it speaks on or creates its own truth. So, according to Foucault there is no universal reality or truth as in poststructuralist thought. He asserts that meaning, truth and morality are created through discourse.<br/>The correct answer is C."

      "E": "Anarchy entails states to seek international help."
    },
    "explanation": "States constantly seek power because of human nature: For neorealism, why states continuously seek power has little to do with human nature. Neorealism explains why states want more power with reference to the structure of the international system.<br/>State leaders and their decisions are the major factors that affect distribution of power: While classical realism mainly focuses on state leaders and their decisions, neorealism, by contrast, emphasizes the structure of the international system that is external to the actors, in particular the relative distribution of power. Leaders are relatively unimportant because structures compel them to act in certain ways. Structures more or less determine actions.<br/>States have more or less similar capabilities for performing similar tasks: States are similar in the tasks they face, not in their abilities to perform them. States are distinguished primarily by their greater or lesser capabilities for performing similar tasks... the structure of a system changes with changes in the distribution of capabilities across the system's units.<br/>The interests and identities of states are constructed by the structure of the system exogenous to them: The interests and identities of states are constructed by the structure of the system exogenous to them. Under the conditions of anarchy, it is logical to assume that states must acquire egoistic identities and take care of themselves or they will risk being crushed.<br/>Anarchy entails states to seek international help: For Waltz, the assumption of anarchy means that states will be unwilling to risk functional differentiation, in other words, an international division of labor. Anarchy compels each state to focus on its core preference - maintaining its sovereignty, i.e. its own survival - without relying on external help.<br/>The correct answer is D."

Neorealism assumes that “only the behavior of states is affected by system structure, not their identities and interests” (Wendt, 1999: 248). Constructivists, on the other hand, emphasize a process of interaction between agents and structures; “the ontology is one of mutual constitution, where neither unit of analysis -agents or structures-is reduced to the other and made ‘ontologically primitive” (Checkel, 1998: 326).<br/>The correct answer is D."

Drawing from Immanuel Kant’s ideas, Wendt argues that this culture is the closest one to a collective security system where states identify with each other and define their interests collectively. In other words, in a Kantian culture states form a community.<br/>The correct answer is C."

Both Realist and Liberal theories generally “explain security by identifying an objective situation as threatening to an objective entity” (Balzacq, 2011a: xiii). In other words, according to traditionalists, security means a freedom from any objective military threat to the state survival in an anarchic international system. The traditional definition of security, however, is most commonly associated with political Realism that defines security as national security. In both classical and structural variants, Realism defines security in terms of national security in which the survival of the state is the main objective. Thus, “Realism is usually seen to emphasize the state as the main object of security, and war as the main threat to it”"

    "explanation": "The economic sector, according to the CS, revolves “around access to the resources, finance and markets necessary to sustain acceptable levels of welfare and state power” (Williams, 2008: 4). Economic threats can have direct consequences for individuals, nations and states thus threaten the very existence of these entities. However, one should keep in mind that while some economic threats can be thought of in terms of economic security, others can only be regarded as politicized issues because of the highly political nature of some economic problems. Thus, it is of crucial importance to make the distinction. Economic threats must be existential threats to be included in the category of securitization. In the economic sector, one can detect various referent objects at different levels. States, individuals, or the global market can be identified as referent objects. The CS argues that economic threats can directly affect the welfare of individuals or social classes and thus can be regarded as existential threats. An economic crisis, for example, can hamper individuals’ access to basic necessities, such as food, clothing, and shelter and constitute an existential threat to individuals. Economic threats can also be presented as threats in other sectors. “What is merely economic or political within the economic sector may have security implications in other sectors” (Buzan et. al., 1998: 106). State representatives, for example, can present an economic crisis as an impediment to the funding of national defense expenditures and consequently an existential threat to national security. States also can securitize threats to the existence of large firms or companies through linking their activities to national security. In the economic sector, state representatives, international organizations and firms can be included in the category of securitizing actors."

Buzan et. al. argue that “the organizing concept in the societal sector is identity. Societal insecurity exists when communities of whatever kind define a development or potentiality as a threat to their survival as a community” (Buzan et. al. 1998: 119). According to the CS, the state is the referent object for political, military environmental and economic security, but society is the referent object for societal security. Thus, the CS treats societal security as a separate referent object of societal security. In this understanding, survival of society is different from survival of the state. “This view implies a duality of security, namely the state and societal security, with the former guarding its sovereignty whilst the latter attempting to keep its identity” (Hama, 2017: 4). Societal security represents the security of ‘we’ identities such as national identity groups (Wæver et. al., 1993: 21). Members of a society share common ideas and practices that help them develop a common identity and form a social group. This identity also helps individuals identify themselves as members of a community. Societal insecurity therefore involves “a development or potentiality as a threat to their survival as a community”."

In other words, <strong>according to traditionalists, security means a freedom from any objective military threat to the state survival in an anarchic international system.</strong>"

The complexity of the environmental sector arises from the fact that there is a great variety of issues related to the environment. The environmental sector has both scientific and political agendas and they often overlap and sometimes shape each other.

Second, Fanon stresses the significance of the revolutionary act as also a psychological and intellectual transformation, which must accompany material transformation, or the socialist reorganization of production.

    "explanation": "The most important part where Bhabha is different from Said and Spivak is that he considers the colonial phenomenon as an opportunity for cultural exchange, and, unlike Spivak, subaltern can actually speak for themselves and this speech emerges as a mimicry and is hybrid.In Bhabha’s words: “Stereotyping is not only the setting up of a false image which becomes the scapegoat of discriminatory practices. It is a much more ambivalent text of projection and introjections, metaphoric and metonymic strategies, displacement, guilt, aggressivity; the masking and splitting of ‘official’ and fantastic knowledges” (Bhabha, 1986: 169). Bhabha points out that the fantasies of the colonial stereotypes often appear as horrors. The discourse of colonialism is frequently populated with ‘terrifying stereotypes of savagery, cannibalism, lust and anarchy’ (Bhabha, 1994: 72). In his essay ‘Of Mimicry and Man’, Bhabha builds on these ideas and explores how the ambivalence of colonized subject becomes a direct threat to the authorities of the colonizers through the effects of ‘mimicry’. Bhabha describes mimicry as ‘one of the most elusive and effective strategies of colonial power and knowledge’ (Bhabha, 1994)."

Spivak is interested in feminist side of post-colonialism, because subaltern women are much more inferior than the others. This is the only thing in Spivak’s perspective that combines feminism and post-colonial basis. An important detail for the women of India at the center of Spivak’s work is the separation of the first world women and the third world women on fate, grievances and rights, and the first world women is close to the metropolitan, that is, the third world women is the lowermost in class system. According to Spivak, the feminist ideology as a main stream is universal and masculine, this is wrong to understand real feminist ideology."

    "explanation": "The most important part where Bhabha is different from Said and Spivak is that he considers the colonial phenomenon as an opportunity for cultural exchange, and, unlike Spivak, subaltern can actually speak for themselves and this speech emerges as a mimicry and is hybrid (Ashcroft, Griffiths, 1989). Mimicry is a process and experience and in fact there is reproduction and development of oneself over its center. Hybridity is the most natural consequence of worldly practice. It should be considered among cultures and especially between colonial cultures and indigenous identities. The correct answer is E."

    "explanation": "Frantz Fanon is the pioneer of post-colonial theory in terms of both problematisation and terminology. The post-colonialist theory was based on Fanon’s works that first analyzed and revealed colonialism as a fundamental problem of knowledge. Frantz Fanon concluded his indictment of colonialism by pronouncing that Europe ‘is literally the creation of the Third World’ in the sense, its material wealth and labour come from the colonies, ‘the sweat and the dead bodies of Negroes, Arabs, Indians and the yellow races’ that have fueled the ‘opulence’ of Europe (Fanon, 1963: 76-81). Fanon’s main claim is that it is the white man who created the black man and the black man himself who created the qualities of the black man. In his approach and developed analysis; Marxism, psychoanalysis, phenomenology and existentialism are affecting factors. Fanon refuses to represent the whole of humanity as created by the French enlightenment in the 18th century, also applies psychoanalysis on black people who were crushed, exploited and humiliated. The world which existed in the pre-modern period appear to be in a regular order in which people could maintain their lives has been systematically transformed into gradual irregularities by the Western promises of illumination and development and this disorder has been used for their exploitation. According to Fanon, it is necessary to play with the order of the new world created by the colonial man and to render his rules unworkable"

    "explanation": "The psychological effects of colonialism were analyzed by Memmi in his book “Portrait of the Colonial” (1957). According to Memmi, it is not possible for the colonists to be unaware of the illegitimacy of their position, but on the contrary, the colonists demonstrate through their actions that they are aware that their welfare has actually been promoted through the misery of what they colonize. Memmi, a member of one of the nonMuslim families of Tunisia, put forward originally the “dual refusal” and “dual responsibility” of his life because, as Sartre points out, Memmi has a slightly more privileged position than most of the colonized because of his non-Muslim status, but he has not yet been fully accepted by the colonists. Thus, the problem of Memmi really is as Sartre answered; Memmi is neither the colonialist nor the colonized, or both. Memmi points at a simple fact: If colonialist’s life standards are high, this is due to the low level of the colonized people (2003). Although he had a relatively privileged position in the community he lived in, Memmi experienced a dual exclusion from both the colonial and the colonized. In his works he dealt with the relationship between these two groups and with one of the most important reference sources of the postcolonial literature with his writings in this field."

Ideological and textual formations need to switch their main subjectivity. It can be analyzed that East was marginalized by the Western world in literature, politics, social and economic life. Eastern people first were colonized, then remembered as being “Other” with Orientalism in the Western form. In Orientalism, Said has mentioned some examples of orientalism that are seen in the studies of European scholars, philosophers, political theorists, poets, historians, travel writers and others (Said, 1979)."

    "explanation": "THE MEANINGS AND BASICS OF CRITICAL THEORY<br/>Critical theory is not only an academic approach but also an emancipatory thought committed to the formation of a more equal and just world. It seeks to explain the reasons why the realization of this goal is difficult to achieve. Therefore, what is crucial is not only the social explanation but also politically motivated action to achieve an alternative set of social relations based on justice and equality. For emancipatory social change, Horkheimer believes that there are some forces of resistance left within humans and that the spirit of humanity is still alive, if not in the individual as a member of social groups, at least in the individual as far as he or she is left alone. Horkheimer is certainly aware of the structural constraints, but he does suggest that it is possible to engage in a kind of non-conformism at least (without much of a description of what it would be like), which comes through the spontaneity of the individual subject.<br/>Critical theory is also deeply concerned with the fate of modernity. It has offered systematic and comprehensive theories of the trajectory of modernity, combined with critical diagnoses of some of the latter’s limitations, pathologies and destructive effects, while providing defenses of some of its progressive elements."

According to Gramsci, cultural hegemony functions by achieving the consent of the masses to abide social norms and the rules of law by framing the worldview of the ruling class. It is most strongly manifested when those ruled by the dominant group come to believe that the economic and social conditions are natural and inevitable, rather than created by people, with a vested interest in a particular capitalist order."

That means that the theory must adequately explain the social problems that exist, it <strong>must offer</strong> practical solutions for how to respond to them, and it must clearly abide by the norms of criticism established by the field. With this point of view, Horkheimer also condemns traditional theorists for producing works that fail to question power, domination, and the status quo, in general (Horkheimer, 1937)."

Superstructure, on the other hand, refers to all other aspects of society. It includes politics, culture, ideology, values, norms and expectations, in general. In Marxist philosophy, the superstructure grows out of the base. That is, economic base determines, at least influences to a great extent, the political and ideological superstructure."

Ideal speech is the critical tool used in the reconstruction of political communities, from local to global levels, through open dialogue and non-coercive communication, a process whereby all affected by political decisions put forward their claims and justify them on the basis of rational and universally-accepted principles of validity (Linklater, 2007a)."

Instead, it finds in them the potential to protect strangers in need and includes them in a broader notion of national interest. To critical theory, solutions to human problems, broadly defined, must be sought in open dialogue, resorting to rational arguments that take into consideration everyone’s concerns and interests. Leaving solutions to national governments alone is not an option due to their rather strict positions on national interests. On the contrary, a more balanced position would result from the active involvement of civil society and local authorities"

In this respect, by inspiring the critical theory, Aberystwyth School analyses the traditional security conception and seeks to examine the involvement of current structures and practices in continuation of repression, inequality and injustice in world politics.

    "explanation": "For Aberystwyth School, priority is not about how security will be ensured, but the sources of security issues. Hence, it is not sufficient to undertake security as a negative security situation. Positive security that comprises social, economic and cultural structures should have a priority. Thus, as long as the concept of security is about the improvement of human welfare, it will have a positive meaning for Aberystwyth School."

Because such a critique requires scientifically “unverified” value judgements. According to Max Horkheimer, traditional theory is about the reproduction of status quo (Sheenan, 2005: 154). Nevertheless, critical theory that questions the objective knowledge argument of positivism, refuses the idea of irrevocability of dominant thoughts, practices and social conditions.

If values and ideas are the reflections of specific social relationships, all knowledge should reflect a specific context, time and space. In other words, knowledge cannot be timeless and objective in contrast to realist argument (Hobden and Jones, 2001: 211). That is why, there is not a simple dividing line between values and facts.

These theories aim to develop a political theory that targets to provide a social transformation through revealing and, if it is possible, eliminating all obstacles for the emancipation of human beings while the traditional theories with a positivist approach are related with the reproduction of the status quo.<br/>The correct answer is C."

    "explanation": "Robert Cox introduced his critiques to dominant theories of international relations with a Gramscian perspective, arguing that “theory is always for someone and for some purposes” (Cox, 1981: 128). If values and ideas are the reflections of specific social relationships, all knowledge should reflect a specific context, time and space. In other words, knowledge cannot be timeless and objective in contrast to realist argument. That is why, there is not a simple dividing line between values and facts. In this context, allegedly all objective and value-free theories, thoughts and analyses should be viewed with a critical manner. According to Cox, regarding the world as given helps to legitimization of dominant hegemonic relationships in world politics. Hence, Cox advocates critical theoretical perspective instead of problem-solving one. Because, critical theory attempts to question the dominant order by analysing and revealing social forces that could lead to emancipatory change.<br/>The correct answer is E."

    },
    "explanation": "Aberystwyth School addresses security theory as a political activity and brings the politics back to security studies by seeking to display the connection between security theory and political order. For the Aberystwyth School, priority is not about how security will be ensured, but the sources of security issues. Hence, it is not sufficient to undertake security as a negative security situation. Positive security that comprises social, economic and cultural structures should have a priority. Thus, <u>as long as the concept of security is about the improvement of human welfare, it will have a positive meaning for the Aberystwyth School</u>. <br/>The concept of “survival plus” that means the security beyond survival of state aims to create appropriate environment for perfection human-beings themselves. In this framework, <u>security refers to positive life conditions beyond the survival needs of the state</u>. According to the Aberystwyth School, <u>security is worthwhile for human collectivities and should be understood as a positive value</u>. Therefore, <u>security is conceptualized as a condition of emancipation of individuals from insecurities</u>.<br/>According to the Aberystwyth School which makes effort to reveal the limitations of traditional security conception, security is a derivative concept based on a priori political understanding. <u>While traditional security conception defines the Security Studies in terms of the study of the threat, use, and control of military force</u>, critical approaches to security focus on the normative choices and their political implications.

This is because, broadening of security agenda is necessarily required to analyse various referent objects of security apart from the state actor.<br/>The state-centric security approaches do not provide theoretical and conceptual tools in order to analyse insecurities of human collectivities and individuals. Hence, Aberystwyth School seeks to give a central position to human emancipation instead of security of the state. Such an effort requires to regard individuals as the privileged referent object of security. Such a conceptualization that gives priority to human emancipation is a radical break from dominant security conception based on national security notion.<br/>In the framework of human security concept, humanitarian needs are much more important than the security needs of the state.<br/>The correct answer is E."

    "explanation": "When the current international security issues are analysed, it is clear that the Western world gives itself a central position and makes non-Western world “others”. Given that the threatened values are the Western values, threats against them emanate from non-Western societies. Therefore, dominant relations, thoughts and actions of contemporary world politics create a hegemony, and solving security problems of this hegemony reflects a unilateral choice without regarding the security needs of all societies of the world.<br/>As xenophobia in the Western societies has increased, interventions conducted in the direction of strategy of “global war on terrorism” have caused massive violations of human rights. In that case, it can be argued that the efforts of the Western world to overcome security problems have contributed to emergence of a global insecurity atmosphere.<br/>In contrast to othering process based on identity that has gained a global characteristic after 11 September, Aberystwyth School draws attention to existence of identity-based oppresive structures that lead to construction of dominative relationships. Therefore, <u>it advocates emancipatory communities based around an inclusionary and egalitarian notions of identity</u>.

    "explanation": "According to Hans J. Morgenthau, the six principles of political realism are as follows: i) politics is governed by objective laws which have roots in human nature; ii) national interest defined in terms of national power; iii) interest is always dynamic; iv) abstract moral principles cannot be applied to politics; v) difference between moral aspirations of a nation and the universal moral principles; and vi) autonomy of international politics. Tickner re-treated the six mentioned principles of Morgenthau which are commonly acknowledged as the underpinning principles of the realist theory.<br/>Tickner emphasized that Morgenthau’s concept of “objective laws” is defined on masculine basis and that Morgenthau, in announcing the objective laws of human nature, proved partial indeed and implied masculine qualities, whereas human nature has both feminine and masculine qualities.<br/>With regard to defining national interest in terms of national power, Tickner argues that in today’s world, the concept of national interest cannot be equated with national power. Tickner suggests that national interests should be addressed based on cooperative relations on mutual interests that would be multi-dimensional in scope and that would involve all actors.<br/>The argument that abstract moral principles cannot be applied to politics is defended by Morgenthau. However, Tickner indicates that moral principles cannot be separated from politics; public sphere cannot be autonomous, and above all, there arose a necessity for questioning the public sphere as it is a sphere that excludes women.<br/>Furthermore, criticising the concept of autonomy, Tickner insisted that this concept should be re-defined in such a way as to internalize the existence of women.<br/>The correct answer is C."
