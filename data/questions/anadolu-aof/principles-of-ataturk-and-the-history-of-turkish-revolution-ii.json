    },
    "explanation": "Following the Armistice of Mudanya, a peace conference was held in Lausanne, Switzerland, to discuss the terms and conditions of a new peace treaty which would replace the Treaty of Sèvres. Before the conference, the TGNA convened and adopted a motion to abolish the Ottoman Sultanate on November 1, 1922. One of the main reasons for such a measure stemmed from the fact that the British government had been trying to undermine the authority of the TGNA by inviting the representatives of the Ottoman Government to the peace talks along with the representative of the Ankara Government (Ahmad, 1993, p.50). This action on the part of the British caused concern in Ankara because, beside undermining the authority of the Ankara Government, having two representatives at the peace conference would also cause two different types of discussions: one maintained by the TGNA and the other by the Ottoman government. Moreover, this duality would also undermine the victories of the TGNA armies against the Allied Powers. Therefore, the abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate became a necessity for the future and salvation of Anatolia and the Turkish C is the correct choice."

    "explanation": "The Turkish War of Independence was carried out according to the principles of a nation state after the TGNA was opened. Ensuing the election of Mustafa Kemal as the President of the TGNA, a government and a commission was established to prepare a constitution for this nation state. The first draft of the constitution was discussed on September 18, 1920 based on a populist program on the national sovereignty. The conservative deputies in the Assembly reacted to this program since they were afraid of a change in the regime of the country. Accordingly, they demanded that the Parliament had to continue to work only until the country and the Caliphate and Sultanate could be saved from the Allies, and they wanted the constitution to be temporary.

    "explanation": "The Constitution of 1921 was a revolutionary constitution set in extraordinary circumstances, but it lacked sections substantial to a constitution such as sections on fundamental rights and freedoms and the judicial system. It consisted of six sections, namely; “basic provisions” (<em>Mevâdd-ı Esasiye</em>) and “administration” (<em>idare</em>), “provinces” (<em>Vilâyet</em>), “sub-district” (Kaza) and counties (<em>Nahiye</em>), general inspectorships (<em>umumi müfettişlik</em>) with twenty-three articles additionally one unordered additional substance (<em>madde-i münferide</em>).

The 1924 Constitution prevailed until 1961; however, some important changes were made in this constitution due to the changes that took place in the country toward establishing a modern democracy. For example, on February 5, 1937, Mustafa Kemal’s six principles, namely, <em>nationalism, populism, republicanism, secularism, statism </em>and r<em>evolutionism</em>, were ingrained into Article 2 of 1924 Constitution (p. 16).

    "explanation": "The position of the caliphate emerged again once the regime became republican. The conservatives continued to use it as the symbol of opposition and as a counter-force to the president of the Republic. Then political tension heightened with the involvement of the Muslims of British India provoked by Britain. This unforeseen interference was accepted as an intervention in the internal affairs and was protested by the Republican People’s Party members. Mustafa Kemal abolished the Caliphate with the support of the People’s Party on March 3, 1924 so that Islam could not be used as a political instrument by the supporters of the old regime against the Republican regime. The TGNA deposed the caliph and banished the house of Ottoman from Turkey on November 1, 1922. When the Caliphate was abolished the position of <em>Şeyhülislam</em>, the Ministry of Religious Foundations (<em>Şer’iye ve Evkaf Vekâleti), </em>and religious courts (<em>Şeriat Mahkemeleri</em>) were also abolished. The Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet İsleri Başkanlığı) replaced the Ministry of Religious Foundations as well as the Directorate of Religious Foundations (<em>Evkaf Müdürlüğü</em>), and all came under the prime minister’s office.

    },
    "explanation": "The constraints brought by the <em>Treaty of Lausanne </em>prevented Turkey from developing an independent policy for industrialization as explained above. Specifically, the Turkish state could not raise import tariffs which, in return, prevented it from developing protective measures and adopting influential foreign trade policy that would enable the expansion of the industrial sector. Nevertheless, the government attempted to develop the industrial base of the country by supporting the private sector. Some measures were taken along with the principles of the industrial activity which had been laid down in the Economic Congress in İzmir in 1923. These principles included promoting legislation for the encouragement of the industry, creating better credit facilities for the industry, and providing instruction, education and training for the engineers in the industry.

    "explanation": "In developing defensive instruments against the crisis, the state increasingly intervened in the situation, adopted a protectionist policy and import-substitution; that is, it attempted to replace some of the imported goods by local production. In order to stabilize the budget and increase the value of Turkish Lira, the Law on Foreign Exchange Markets (<em>Menkul Kıymetler ve Kambiyo Borsaları Kanunu</em>) was enacted (December 1929) and the Law on the Protection of the Value of Turkish Lira <em>(Türk Parasının Kıymetini Koruma Hakkında Kanun) </em>was introduced in February 1930.

In the Congress, a program calling active intervention of the state in agriculture, commerce, and industry was accepted.

    "explanation": "Ètatism, not clearly defined by the government in its initial phase, came to mean the state’s responsibility for investing in industry, creating and running industries that the private sector could not due to lack of sufficient capital, and supervising the production in these industries. In other words, the state was going to be the leading actor in economic development as an investor and a producer. It was a system specific to Turkey which originated from the principles of private enterprises. Yet, it placed a great role on the state in developing the national economy. Therefore, it was neither socialist nor liberal D is the correct choice."

    },
    "explanation": "During the étatist period, protective measures which were adopted in the aftermath of the Great Depression to control the foreign trade were maintained. The nationalization of foreign investments, especially in the areas of public utilities, mining and railways, continued. Some further restrictions and controls were put on the foreign capital. Remarkably different from the preceding years, the government tightened its control of the internal markets during the étatist era. It directly or indirectly followed the support policy for a number of agricultural goods. The Agricultural Bank regulated the prices. A is the correct choice."

      "E": "I, II, III, IV"
    },
    "explanation": "The implementation of the National Protection Law, especially fixing prices at low values, led to the rise of a black market economy. Big farmers, merchants and even some officials who were in a position to exploit the large degree of government intervention in economy made great fortunes. While the big farmers gained enormously from the rise in agricultural prices, the merchants benefited much from having the permit of importing some necessary items that they could sell at high prices. The fortunes that both sectors gained were exempt from taxation or control by the government. As the government needed more income to meet its expenditures, it decided to impose extraordinary taxes through which it would tax such fortunes. The first extraordinary tax in case was the Wealth Tax (<em>Varlık Vergisi</em>). In its implementation, there were no standards. Consequently, the tax was mostly paid by merchants in Istanbul, notably by non-Muslims who were subjected to rates higher than those of the Muslims (Zürcher 1993, p. 208). In June 1943, the government introduced taxes for agriculture products. It aimed to tax especially farmers who accumulated considerable wealth because of the tremendous increase in the prices of agricultural products. However, the government was not successful in collecting the taxes, especially from big landowners who were able to avoid government control. E is the correct choice."

In an effort to respond to the challenge from the Democratic Party domestically and as a way of developing a close relationship with the United States, the majority in the Republican People’s Party favored a departure from ètatism to adopt a more liberal economic policy. In 1947, the declaration of the <em>Truman Doctrine </em>and the following <em>Marshall Aid Program </em>gave impetus to the economic liberalization of Turkey. The American economic missions who came to Turkey mostly recommended the government to curtail ètatism and favor free enterprise. In their reports, they stated that this was a prerequisite for the American aid to Turkey. C is the correct choice."

These were regarded as the fundamental and unchanging principles guiding the Republic, and were eventually written into the Constitution.\n<br/>Thus, the early Turkish Republic expected significant shifts in structure and identities to realize its overarching goal of modernization: from an imperial structure to a nation-sate and from Ottoman identities to a<strong> Turkish identity rooted in Turkish nationalism based on a common culture and a shared past in the official rhetoric.</strong>"

    "explanation": "The two fields of history and language stand out and have been inseparable as fundamental building blocks of Turkish cultural nationalism and nationbuilding efforts in the 1930s as they did in several European and other nations’ implementations. Nationalist ideologies have not regarded nations<br/>as modern constructs, but rather as primordial entities existing since time immemorial. Within that perspective, a common history becomes conceivably of supreme importance for a sense of nationhood and the development of national identity. This implication usually leads to a reshaping of history at the hands of the elite and the creation of a narrative according to which a nation<br/>presupposes a shared past in a certain way. Nationbuilding efforts and collective identity formation attempts turn the preferred representation of the past and its dissemination into an ever more invaluable asset in generating legitimacy for and loyalty to new political structures or even existing systems."

The political and cultural elite attributed great importance to physical appearance as it indicated, in their view, a sign of modernity and ideological transformation.\n Women again played a special role here. The regime did not legally ban veiling except on official premises, but vigorous campaigns discouraged wearing it and pressed for modern styles in the western model. Additionally, giving up the veil was regarded as integral part of women’s emancipation and modernization and as a return to the roots of Turkish culture.\n <strong>Explicit femininity came to be depreciated and discouraged</strong>."

Imports and trade, which had already declined due to the 1929 world economic crisis, almost dropped to a half and suffered even further when the Allied Powers forced Turkey to stop any mercantile activity with Germany.\n<br/>Therefore, the economic policies of the 1940s were not geared towards industrialization and development as in the 1930s."

This endeavor resulted in the creation of a multi-purpose, tailor-made institution, namely the Village Institutes, which started out in 1940 and were fully terminated by 1954 by the Democrat Party regime.\n The overarching motive behind the establishment of these new schools was to educate the provincial population of a still predominantly agrarian society on the spot. This would develop, transform, modernize villages and prevent domestic relocations by keeping the population content in their respective provinces.\n From an educational perspective, the Institutes embodied a holistic approach and the basis of their program rested on the school of “learning by doing” theory. They provided both academic and applied instruction to village students: the former was supposed to cultivate their minds and the latter improve their daily lives and districts."

    "explanation": "In 1895, Mustafa Kemal entered the Monastir Military High School (<em>Manastır Askerî İdadîsi</em>) in Monastir, a military town where the headquarters of the Ottoman Third Army located. Mustafa Kemal became a nationalist during that time since gangs of Serbs and Bulgarians raided the Turkish villages and there was also the ongoing Ottoman-Greek war in 1897; indeed, he was eager to join the Turkish volunteers to fight against the Greeks. He was also under the influence of nationalist poets, such as Namık Kemal. Mustafa Kemal graduated from the War Academy as a staff captain (<em>kurmay yüzbaşı</em>) in 1905, when he was 24 years old. Following his graduation from the War Academy, Mustafa Kemal was imprisoned because of his opposing activities and thoughts on the Sultan and his authoritarian rule. B is the correct choice."

      "E": "The Military Encampment of Cumalı"
    },
    "explanation": "From 1905 until 1907, Mustafa Kemal was an intern at the 30th Cavalry Regiment of the Fifth Army in Damascus. While in Damascus, he continued engaging in political activities. With the aid of some of his colleagues and friends, including Dr. Mustafa (Cantekin) and Müfit (Özdeş), he secretly founded the Society. of Homeland and Freedom (<em>Vatan ve Hürriyet Cemiyeti</em>) to fight against Sultan Abdülhamid II’s despotism. In 1907, he was promoted to Adjutant- Major and sent to the Third Army at Salonika. There, the Society of Homeland and Freedom merged with the Ottoman Society of Freedom (<em>Osmanlı Hürriyet Cemiyeti</em>) and the latter joined the Ottoman Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) (<em>Osmanlı İttihat ve Terakki Cemiyeti</em>), which forcefully persuaded Sultan Abdülhamid II to restore the constitution of 1876 and open the parliament. So, choices A, B, C provide the names of these groups. In 1908, in Salonika, Mustafa Kemal translated and published General Litzmann’s book, <em>The Combat Drill of the Platoon</em>, which was about military battle practices. Its second edition came out in Istanbul in 1912. So, choice D provides the name of this book which he did not write but translated. In 1909, he published <em>The Military Encampment of Cumalı </em>and in 1918, <em>A Friendly Talk with the Officer and the Commander</em>. Later, he published his <em>Speech, </em>which he delivered in 1927. During the late 1930s, Mustafa Kemal published a geometry book in which he coined a new terminology for a confusing list of geometric names. He also wrote a civics manual. His memoirs of his days in Karlsbad, where he stayed in a sanatorium; other notes, speeches, declarations, telegrams, correspondences, memoirs, private letters, and conversations have also been published under the name Collected Works of Atatürk.

    },
    "explanation": "The Speech started explaining the condition of the country when Mustafa Kemal landed at Samsun on May 19, 1919. In his view, the enemy powers were attacking the Ottoman State and the country itself in order to disintegrate and annihilate both. The Sultan/Caliph wanted to save his life and comfort while the nation was suffering in darkness and uncertainty. There were some who looked for ways to save the country (p.7). The Nation and the Army knew of the Sultan/ Caliph’s treachery. Nevertheless, for those with a fundamentalist, religious outlook and traditional inclinations, their ties remained loyal to the throne. Mustafa Kemal also focused on how he disagreed with those who demanded protection from England and wanted to accept the United States of America as a mandatory power. Those who advocated mandate rule sought to preserve the integrity of the Ottoman state under one single power rather than to allow it to be divided among several states (p. 8-9). Another proposal that he reproached allowed each region to act independently utilizing its own resources either to stay as part of the state or to seek its own safety without the state (p. 9). Mustafa Kemal rejected all three proposals. C is the correct choice."

Atatürk believed in statism, so he supported the state control in economy (p. 136). Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is certain to pave the way for a democratic regime in Turkey. With a genuine parliamentary government whose structure and principles had been drawn during his days, Atatürk left behind a structure of democracy which came to full realization in 1950.

    },
    "explanation": "In 1918, after the Ottoman Empire signed the Mudros Armistice, the Allied fleets entered Istanbul, and this led to the dissolution of the Ottoman Parliament. In April 1919, Mustafa Kemal was appointed as the Nineth (later Third) Army Inspector in Anatolia with the approval of the British, who at that moment were advising the Sultan on the matters of the state. His assignment was the implementation of the terms of the Mudros Armistice as well as demobilizing the armed forces that were still intact.\n On May 15, 1919, the Greeks occupied İzmir, which led to massive disturbances. This was a traumatic event in the history of the Ottomans and modern Turkey. Under such circumstances, Mustafa Kemal left Istanbul for Samsun on May 16, and arrived in the city on May 19, 1919."

    "explanation": "On July 9, 1919, Mustafa Kemal decided to resign from all of his official duties, and he declared himself a civilian since he realized that he could not go on with his liberation activities as an Ottoman officer. Even though he was a civilian after that date, the high ranking commanders of the Ottoman army such as Kazım (Karabekir) Pasha, who was the highest ranking officer in the region as the commander to the armed forces in Erzurum, supported him in his endeavors.\n In those days, a representative committee was formed and Mustafa Kemal became its president. <strong>He convened the Sivas Congress, where all the Defense of Rights Associations united under his leadership.</strong> After signing of the Amasya Protocol between Istanbul government and the Representative Committee, a new Parliament was elected in Istanbul with a nationalist representation. Mustafa Kemal was elected as deputy from Erzurum, but he did not go to Istanbul. Instead, he established the headquarters of the resistance movement in Ankara with the Representative Committee."

    "explanation": "According to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Statism was for the highest interests of the nation. Like Mustafa Kemal’s other principles, Statism was born as a product of the conditions arisen in the 1920s Anatolia, where infrastructure and industry were weak or practically non-existent. Initially, during the period of 1923-1930, private enterprises were expected to come up with the necessary investments to develop the country. However, private investments were not sufficient enough. At the same time, Turkey had the burdens of the Ottoman debts, and the Treaty of Lausanne had some limits that prevented the state from having a full economic independence in the 1920s. The limits of the Treaty was finally lifted in 1928 and Turkey had the opportunity to have more economic independence."

    "explanation": "Since Mustafa Kemal’s death, there have been some departures from his principles. After his death, historical and linguistic theories were revised, and later they were abandoned, but <strong>Turkish nationalism continued to have a role in modern Turkey.</strong> The Turkish blood, the links with ancient civilizations such as the Hittites or Sumerians, the role of the proto-Turks in human civilization do not find much ground in current day Turkey.\n Although Mustafa Kemal gave a small role to the Ottoman past in the Turkish history, in the 1940s and onwards, and especially after 1950s, Ottoman history gained ground and Turkish modernization had been dated back to the late Ottoman reformers starting in the eighteenth century. Military interventions in Turkey were said to be made in the name of Atatürkism. In 1980s, a new cultural policy reconciled Turkish nationalism with Islam. Thus, ultrasecularist xenophobic nationalism emerged in the late 1990 as a counter movement. In this atmosphere, there have been attacks on Atatürk and his principles by ultra-religious groups. In spite of these, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s personal cult has remained strong in current-day Turkey"

    "explanation": "Both secularism and nationalism had already been promoted by the Young Turks in the Ottoman Empire in the 1910s. Secularism in the 1930s went beyond the Young Turks’ views that meant separating state and religion and removing religion from the public life, a French type of secularism. The aim was to establish state control over religion and religious institutions. It did not mean, however, to be against religion; but rather, it meant separating it from scientific and purely political matters. Mustafa Kemal advised people to follow technology and civilization, not sheiks and religious institutions. In other words, secularism promoted reason rather than dogmas and superstitions. In November 1937, at the opening session of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, he said that our principles were not dogmas in the books which came from heaven."

    "explanation": "Statism meant that the state took its place as an entrepreneur in economic life. This principle was resorted to as there was no time for individual entrepreneurs to accumulate capital for investment. Therefore, the state took over and made the necessary investments. According to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Statism was for the highest interests of the nation. Like Mustafa Kemal’s other principles, Statism was born as a product of the conditions arisen in the 1920s Anatolia, where infrastructure and industry were weak or practically non-existent. Initially, during the period of 1923-1930, private enterprises were expected to come up with the necessary investments to develop the country. However, private investments were not sufficient enough. At the same time, Turkey had the burdens of the Ottoman debts, and the Treaty of Lausanne had some limits that prevented the state from having a full economic independence in the 1920s. The limits of the Treaty was finally lifted in 1928 and Turkey had the opportunity to have more economic independence. A more independent and protectionist economy came with the economic crisis that broke out in 1929, the Great Depression, which shook the world as a complete failure of the liberal economic policies. In the 1930s, Turkey, thus, developed Statism as a solution to its economic problems where both the infrastructure and the industry would be established by the state. As part of the Statist policies, for example, the state established ownerships in rails, tobacco, alcohol, sugar, matches, explosives, and so on."

Moreover, the rejection of a mandate regime and of the Great Powers’ protectorate at the Sivas Congress was also another response to the Allies. All these decisions formed the bases of the National Pact that determined the principles of the foreign policy. Consequently, the government used the National Pact as her basis at the London Conference in 1921 as well as in <em>Treaty of Ankara </em>and <em>Treaty of Kars </em>signed in 1921 with minor changes.

    "explanation": "Turkey’s peaceful foreign policy contributed to the regional politics in a period when the unresolved border issues, and heavy war damages of World War I created tension in Europe including the Balkans and in the Mediterranean region. These disputes were between the countries supporting the status quo and those which are anti-status quo. The first attempt to establish regional peace was achieved through the Balkan Entente which was the product of mutual efforts of Venizelos, the Greek Premier, and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the President of the Turkish Republic. In support of the peace keeping efforts, there was a series of Balkan conferences held with the participation of Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey in Athens in 1929, in Istanbul in 1931, and in Thessaloniki in 1932. The result of these conferences was the signing of the Balkan Entente or the Balkan Pact between Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Romania in Athens on February 9, 1934. With this pact, they guaranteed each other’s territorial integrity and independence and decided to settle disputes among the signatories peacefully. Bulgaria, however, did not sign it until 1938 since she had territorial claims from Turkey and Greece. This Pact was maintained until World War II. It became null after the Italian occupations in the Balkans. Each signatory state had to take care of its own interests on its own. Turkey’s contribution to the regional politics was not limited to the Balkans. She also played an active role in contributing to peace with her neighboring countries in the east starting from the 1920s onward. The Sadabad Pact was signed in 1937 between Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan. E is the correct choice."

    "explanation": "Among the problems that prevented Turkey’s full rapprochement with the world was the control of the Straits which was under the authority of an international commission as stipulated by the Lausanne Peace Treaty. On April 11, 1936, Turkey applied to the League of Nations to present her concerns about a possible threat that she might receive from the Straits and requested the control of the Straits to be transferred to Turkey. The League of Nations saw the justification in Turkey’s claim. Britain, the Soviet Union, the Balkan Entente members, and the Permanent Council backed her request. These steps brought about the political and legal basis for the <em>Montreux Convention </em>signed on July 20, 1936 in Switzerland. According to the <em>Montreux Convention</em>, Turkey obtained the right to organize and arm the Straits for her security in the times of both war and peace. The convention also allowed Turkey to close the straits to all warships in and during the times of war but to permit merchant ships free passage. While all signatories of Lausanne accepted the Turkish proposal and signed the convention, Italy was not happy with this outcome at the beginning. Two years later, Turkey signed a separate agreement with Italy on May 2, 1938. This was another successful and peaceful outcome and solution of one of the issues left unsolved in Lausanne.

However, due to the fact that Bulgaria did not abandon its expansionist policies, these efforts of the Balkan states did not yield a positive result. Because of Bulgaria’s efforts to change the Neuilly Agreement in her favor, the rest of the Balkan states decided either to abandon their attempts for a Balkan Pact or to make one and leave Bulgaria out until Bulgaria would want to join in. The result of the conferences was the signing of the Balkan Entente, known as the Balkan Pact, between Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Romania on February 9, 1934 in Athens. With this pact they guaranteed each other’s territorial integrity and independence and establishing machinery to settle disputes among the signatories.\n Bulgaria, however, did not sign this Pact until 1938 because she claimed Dobrudja as hers from Rumania, Macedonia, Yugoslavia, and Greece; Western Thrace from Greece, and Edirne and left bank of the River Maritsa from Turkey even though relations with her was improving."

The aim was to end some border issues between France, Germany, and Belgium determined at the Paris Conference after World War I. <strong>The Treaty of Versailles that followed the Peace Conference stipulated that Germany would pay war reparations for the damages she caused to the Allies.</strong> The amount to be paid was not determined. A Reparation Commission made up of members from Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy was established. Germany, along with the other conditions put upon her by the Versailles, was very reactionary to this stipulation. In fact, she failed to pay her interim payments. As a result of this “the Allies ordered that she immediately make up the shortfall. When Germany failed to comply with the stipulations of the Treaty, the Allies, in March 1921, occupied three cities in the industrially important Ruhr as well as most of the customs posts on Germany’s western borders.” French occupation of Ruhr, in particular, caused “passive German resistance”."

Military mobilization for defense increased the numbers of the Turkish army from 120.000 to 1.5 million and the maintenance of this force meant an enormous economic burden on the budget. Among other measures, the state had to raise the share of the Ministry of National Defense from 30% to 50%. Military conscription further harmed the economy by the ensuing labor deficiency, which decreased agricultural production by about 42% and caused a decline in manufacturing by 50%. The volume of international trade contracted significantly as well. These conditions led predictably to shortage of goods, enormous price increases, inflation, hoarding, black marketing, profiteering, and corruption. E is the correct choice."

    "explanation": "The Turkish Parliament passed the <em>National Protection Law </em>on January 18, 1940, which fully legitimized all possible interventions and actions of the state in economic matters. This law became the legal foothold of all the economic measures and gave the government extensive rights to control economic life. The government alone came to control the relations of production, labor, supply, distribution, rationing, consumption, and foreign trade. Domestic issues received attention first.

    },
    "explanation": "<strong>Reflections of State Economic Measures: </strong>The National Protection Law in general angered the masses who eventually lost trust in the government for not being able to mitigate the unbearable economic conditions despite the vast authority the law granted the state and the sacrifices it imposed on the people. The Capital Tax allowed cash flow into the treasury and helped some decrease in wholesale prices in the short term. In the long run, though, it damaged the confidence of most entrepreneurs in the state, entailed hesitancy in investment, and thus curbed private enterprise. Although the tax was instituted to correct inflation and excessive profits, it also seemed to serve to erase the commercial inequalities between non-Muslim and Muslim groups and alter the balance in favor of the latter. However, the Muslim business holders felt insecure as well, thinking they might be next in line. Inflation, the decline in purchasing power, and the limited availability of basic goods crushed other urban sectors, especially the salaried groups with fixed incomes, beyond endurance. In addition to these adversities, many urbanites felt aggravated by witnessing others enriched through hoarding, speculation, and black marketing - problems the state tried to avert but with little success. On the rural front, the Agricultural Products Tax became a heavy burden on the small peasantry, impoverishing them on top of the hardships of military conscription, requisition of animals, and forced labor. D is the correct choice."

    },
    "explanation": "<strong>Side Effects of Socio-Economic Conditions and Disruption of Public Order: </strong>The intolerable economic conditions and the resultant poverty had several repercussions on social life, leading to the instability and disintegration of public order in general. The gravity of financial circumstances and destitution disrupted family life, and marriages started falling apart. Violence became visible on streets, and skirmishes or fights grew into everyday scenes. Crimes, especially petty theft, increased tremendously due to lack of provisions and means. Despair steered some women to prostitution, which exploded during the World War II years. Foreclosure suits and penal proceedings in courts skyrocketed due the increased number of crimes committed or the inability to pay the assessed taxes. Penitentiaries became overcrowded and the authorities neglected the proper provision of prisoners’ needs, especially food, as feeding the population at large was already a considerable challenge. Public health massively deteriorated due to diminished hygiene and malnutrition. Diseases such as typhoid, tuberculosis, malaria, leishmaniosis, and trachoma started spreading and proved to be difficult to contain because of the limited availability of medication. Conversations about the war and related steady routines hegemonized everyday life psychologically and practically. The confines of the martial law in big cities, daily dim-outs, regular defense instructions at schools in case of active warfare, propaganda on prudence and frugality dominated the population’s minds and influenced their conduct. Piety escalated in the era with people trying to find spiritual comfort and strength for coping with the hardships they experienced. Different opinions on current circumstances underlined intellectual polarities of the time and furthermore politicized the young generation. E is the correct choice."

    "explanation": "The ideal solution regarding German_soviet Union encounter from Turkey’s point of view was to see both the Soviet Union and Germany not to succeed in the war. If the Soviet Union became successful, it would be the dominant power in Eastern Europe and thus it would demand its own terms on the Straits. If the Soviet Union collapsed, Germany’s next victim would be Turkey. In order to avoid these, Turkey hoped that Germany and the Allied powers would reach an agreement that would hinder both Germany and the Soviet Union from holding a dominant position in the Eastern Europe.\n Turkey’s position in World War II effectively changed in October-November 1942, when Germany was defeated at elAlamein and the Allies landed in Algeria and Morocco effectively ending the Axis threat to the Middle East. Furthermore, Germany surrendered at Stalingrad in February 1943. Having evaluated these developments, Turkey preferred Germany to reach an agreement with the Allied powers since she did not want the Soviet Union to be dominant in Eastern Europe.\n The French Vichy government took control of Syria against the nationalist de Gaul sympathizers in June and in July. There was an anti-British rebellion in Iraq in early April. The Syrian position was important for Turkey. There was an attack from the Balkans or Caucasus on Turkey; Syria would be the connecting link with the British forces in Palestine. If Iraq fell to the German hands, then, Turkey would be surrounded by hostile forces and would be cut off from her supply route from Basra. Turkey could not favor Iraq’s occupation by Germany or its blockage by Britain; therefore, she offered mediation between Iraq and Britain. Fortunately, the revolt in Iraq was suppressed in May 1941."

In January and February 1944, Turkey had increased the shipment of chromium to Germany from 13,564 tons to 56,649 tons (Deringil, p. 168) Turkish foreign minister Numan Menemencioğlu said that Turkey would not stop her chromium export to Germany. At the TGNA, he made it clear that Turkey had had an alliance with Britain since 1939. She had not been neutral because she was an ally.

    "explanation": "The domestic factors emanated from the widespread discontent experienced by different segments of the society during the war. One of the groups was the peasantry who formed approximately 80 % of the population. The peasants were mostly small farmers. From the establishment of the Republic until World War II, the living conditions of the citizens in the rural areas did not improve much. Furthermore, the war years were catastrophic for this group. Extraordinary measures taken during the world war by the government had adverse effects on the peasantry. The conscription of the male population, the drafting of animals, the forced purchases from producers at below-market prices, and the imposition of the compulsory labor worsened the socio-economic situation of the peasantry (Karaömerlioğlu, 2006, 94-95). At the end of the war, the peasantry was probably the most alienated social group from the government. Similarly, wage and salary earners in the urban centers were displeased about the wartime economic conditions as their incomes dramatically declined. Their income was frozen by the government. As the price index continuously increased during the war, they experienced hardships in maintaining their living standards. They were poorer at the end of the war compared to its beginning. The discontent of the traders and landowners posed the most serious challenge to the government. The civil-military bureaucracy, the intellectuals, and this particular group had formed the backbone of the Republican People’s Party’s power. Despite the fact that they benefited from the wartime economic situation and that they were among the economically advantaged, they were scared of the immense state power that could and did impose harsh measures such as the Wealth Tax or the Tax for Agricultural Products. For the large landowners, the government’s attempt to distribute land to the farmers was another reason for their further alienation from the Republican People’s Party. Consequently, as a result of the socio-economic developments during World War II, a widespread discontent arose that was entirely directed against the government which had been ruling the country without opposition for many years."

The United States emerged as a dominant world power from the war. Its values such as liberal democracy impressed and influenced Turkey. Yet, they were not sufficient to lead to a transformation in the political system. The second factor was the Soviet hostility that Turkey felt very strongly as soon as the war ended."

Then, the Soviet state raised the same issue directly with the Turkish government. Later, in March 1945, it communicated to Turkish authorities that it would not renew the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression with Turkey that had been the basis of good relations between the two states since 1920s. The Soviet authorities did not make any new demands or suggestions for the renewal of the Treaty in their communication. The conditions for the renewal of the Treaty were discussed in conversations between the ministers of foreign affairs of the two states in June 1945. There were mainly two demands of the Soviets: first, the restoration of the areas in northeastern Anatolia (Kars and Ardahan) which had been within the Russian borders between 1878 and 1918 and, second, the establishment of a joint Turkish-Russian defense force on the Straits."

The state apparatus and the Republican People’s Party had almost merged in the single-party era; bureaucracy was considered as the extension of the party. For this reason, the Democrats did not have confidence in the bureaucracy and the military despite the change of power."

Then, the Soviet state raised the same issue directly with the Turkish government. Later, in March 1945, it communicated to Turkish authorities that it would not renew the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression with Turkey that had been the basis of good relations between the two states since 1920s. The Soviet authorities did not make any new demands or suggestions for the renewal of the Treaty in their communication."

    "explanation": "Plenary debates on the proposal of a Land Reform Bill started in May 1945. The main goal of the proposal was the distribution of land to landless peasants and to peasants who had insufficient land on the condition that they cultivated these lands themselves. There were heated discussions in the Assembly over the bill by two main groups: those who supported the Bill and those who vehemently criticized it. The stiff opposition against the Bill came mainly from deputies who had connections with big landowners or who were big landowners themselves. Their spokesman was Adnan Menderes, a large landowner from Aydın. They claimed that the Bill was violating the right to private property granted under the Constitution. It would impede investment in agriculture and lead to insufficient farming, as it did not pay attention to the production capacity of the farms and the means of cultivation (Karpat, 1959, pp. 119-120; Zürcher, 1993, pp. 219-220). The discussions on the Land Reform Bill sometimes turned into the criticism of the single-party system. On June 7, 1945, four opposition members of the Assembly; namely, Adnan Menderes, Celâl Bayar, Refik Koraltan, and Fuat Köprülü submitted a proposal to the Republican People’s Party Parliamentary group -known as the Proposal of the Four (Dörtlü Takrir). This document demanded the full implementation of the Constitution and the removal of all restrictions on civil liberties for the realization of a fully democratic state. The emphasis was that Turkey had to take its place among the world’s democracies and conform to the new global accord that had been shaped by the victory of the democracies in World War II."

Extraordinary measures taken during the world war by the government had adverse effects on the peasantry.

The changing attitude of the government toward religion became obvious, especially in 1949, in the areas of public education and public religious observances. In January, Şemsettin Günaltay, known for his Islamist sympathies, was appointed as the Prime Minister. Soon after his appointment, the new government introduced elective courses on Islam in the primary schools. The establishment of the Preacher and Prayer Schools (İmam-Hatip Okulları) soon followed. In the same year, the Faculty of Divinity of Ankara University was founded. The government stated that the main goal of religious education was to provide religious training in accordance with secularism. This was to prevent the spread of obscurantism and religious fanaticism. As these moves came a year before the elections, the opposition claimed that they were manipulations of the government to get electoral support.\n Although the Democrat Party did not tolerate the Islamic fundamentalist currents after taking over the power in the 1950 elections, it had a lenient approach toward religious activities. It led the abrogation of the legislation prohibiting the reading of the ezan, call to prayer, in Arabic soon after they took over. It also introduced the regular Koran recitals over the Ankara and Istanbul radios and strengthened the organization of the Presidency of Religious Affairs (Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı).The number of mosques and preacher schools increased considerably during the Democrat Party’s rule."

    "explanation": "Ecevit’s success in the 1973 elections was undoubtedly the result of the party’s new orientation. Yet, equally important was the fragmentation of the right in this regard. There were at least four parties in the right wing competing for the votes of the similarly inclined population. The Justice Party was the strongest among them and actually seemed to be best placed to win in the elections. However, it was divided in 1970. A group of deputies who resigned from the party founded the Democratic Party (see below). Two other significant parties arose toward the end of the 1960s. The first was the Nationalist Action Party (Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi). It was led by Alpaslan Türkeş, who, after his return to Turkey in 1963, had joined the Republican Peasant’s Nation Party and became its chairman. In 1969, the party’s name was changed to Nationalist Action Party. It adopted an ideology based on Turkish nationalism with an emphasis on Islam as a part of the Turkish national heritage. Another party that emerged at the end of the 1960s was the National Order Party (Millî Nizam Partisi). It was founded by Necmettin Erbakan, who adopted an Islamic discourse in criticizing Süleyman Demirel and the Justice Party for being subservient to big business and foreign capital. He defended the interests of small businessmen and artisans whose socioeconomic situation deteriorated as a result of the economic policy followed by the Justice Party. The party was closed down following the military memorandum. Erbakan resumed his political activity in 1972 when he founded the National Salvation Party (Millî Selamet Partisi). The Republican People’s Party also took advantage of the closure of the Worker’s Party of Turkey (Türkiye İşçi Partisi) in the aftermath of the military memorandum. This party had been founded in 1961 by trade unionists."

    "explanation": "Following the military takeover on May 27, 1960, the power to govern was in the hands of the National Unity Committee (Millî Birlik Komitesi), which consisted of 38 officers. Its head was Cemal Gürsel, who was appointed as the Head of State, Prime Minister, and Minister of Defense at the same time. From the very beginning, the Committee was divided into two factions: the moderates and the radicals. Led by Gürsel and the generals, the former faction demanded the restoration of power to civilians as soon as possible. The latter faction consisted of junior officers led by Colonel AlpaslanTürkeş. It aimed to change the political structure of the country before it took a turn back to civilian politics. This would necessitate a long military rule (Ahmad, 1977, p. 165). A struggle for power between these groups started immediately after the military takeover."

The overall aim of the constitution was the prevention of one-party monopoly on power, the kind of power which had been previously held by the Democrat Party or the Republican Party in the 1930s. To this end, the national assembly was counterbalanced with other institutions. A bicameral parliament including a national assembly and a senate was established. All legislation would have to pass through both chambers. In addition, an independent constitutional court was introduced. The court could throw out all legislation that it regarded as unconstitutional. In order to lessen the chance of one party getting an overwhelming majority in the assembly, a new electoral law based on proportional representation was introduced. The judiciary, the universities, and the media were granted full autonomy. The constitution also guaranteed freedom of thought, expression, association, and publication"

Some influential factions mostly formed by junior officers wanted to annul the election results, abolish political parties and the National Unity Committee, and establish the rule of military for an indefinite time. The Armed Forces Union would prevent this type of action from happening. The Parliament convened on October 26, following the signature of a protocol by the party leaders who were actually summoned by the army commanders. They agreed not to seek amnesty for the Democrat Party members sentenced at Yassıada. They agreed to elect Cemal Gürsel as President and accepted İsmet İnönü to be the Prime Minister although the Republican People’s Party did not have the sufficient votes to form a majority government. As a result, under heavy pressure from the military, the Justice Party agreed to collaborate in a coalition led by İsmet İnönü. From November 1961 to 1964, Turkey was ruled by four coalition governments, three of which led by the Republican People’s Party under military pressure. This period was marked by political instability as the threat of a military intervention held the coalition governments together. The first coalition was between the Republican People’s Party and the Justice Party (November 1961-May 1962). It did not last long since there were fundamental differences between the two parties toward the issue of amnesty for the former Democrat Party politicians as well as an economic policy based on state planning (see below). The second coalition was between the Republican People’s Party and two smaller parties: the Republican Peasant’s Nation Party and the New Turkey Party (June 1962-December 1963). It was followed by the last İsmet İnönü-led coalition: a minority coalition by the Republican People’s Party which was supported by independents (December 1963-February 1965). The last coalition was formed by the an independent elected from the Justice Party list. Its role was to lead the country to the parliamentary elections, which would be held in October 1965."

    "explanation": "To the surprise of all the political actors, the Republican People’s Party led by Bülent Ecevit was the winner of the elections. Until the 1973 elections, this party had actually undergone a fundamental transformation. It adopted a centerleft ideology in the political spectrum. This emphasized social justice and social security. The election of Bülent Ecevit as secretary-general of the party in 1966 was a critical step, which would shape the future of the party. Ecevit viewed the center-left policy as the one that could transform the Republican People’s Party into an organization that could and would accommodate the social and economic changes of the 1960s and 1970s. He wanted to identify the party with people and end its elitist image. This would enable the party to broaden its popular base by having the peasantry and working class on its side. Ecevit’s popularity within the party increased when he resigned from the secretary-general post in a protest of the support given by İsmet İnönü, chairman of the party, to the Nihat Erim government which had been established after the military memorandum of March 12, 1971. In 1972, Ecevit was elected as the chairman of the party in the party congress by defeating İsmet İnönü, much to everyone’s surprise, and became the third chairman after Atatürk and İsmet İnönü."

The implementation of this program became the priority of the Demirel government, which succeeded Ecevit in October 1979. Demirel gave the task of preparing a reform package to Turgut Özal, and he, then, became the under-secretary for economic affairs in charge of planning.

To this end, the national assembly was counterbalanced with other institutions. A bicameral parliament including a national assembly and a senate was established. All legislation would have to pass through both chambers. In addition, an independent constitutional court was introduced. The court could throw out all legislation that it regarded as unconstitutional. In order to lessen the chance of one party getting an overwhelming majority in the assembly, a new electoral law based on proportional representation was introduced. The judiciary, the universities, and the media were granted full autonomy. The constitution also guaranteed freedom of thought, expression, association, and publication.

If happened, gaining absolute majority that would allow the formation of a Republican People’s Party government alone was quite possible. Yet, the parties of the Right were aware of the fact that going to elections under the existing circumstances would be a political suicide for them.
