    "explanation": "In the beginning of the 13th century, there were hundreds of city-states on the Italian peninsula. Gradually absorbed by the more powerful ones, by the 14th century more than twenty cities had populations over 20,000 people (Merriman, 2010: 45). Since urban areas were far more prone to the spread of ideas, the Renaissance kicked off in cities such as Florence, Venice, Siena, and Milan. What<br/>made it possible was the economic prosperity and social dynamism of city-states, polities that had grown rich and independent from trade in the Mediterranean and Black Sea since the 11th century (Merriman, 2010: 46). These trade routes increased international trade in the region and helped citystates create small-scale manufacturing. As a result, Italian merchants grew very wealthy. This also helped develop a sophisticated banking system in the city-states in the 14th and 15th centuries, thus further financing internal trade and international commerce (Merriman, 2010: 46). The most prominent among them, such as Florence, soon became central to financing monarchies and even<br/>the papacy (Merriman, 2010: 46). These developments led to increasing urbanization, eroded the power of the nobility, and increased the influence of townsmen. Before long urban merchants enriched by commerce had become important to local political life and soon joined the ruling elite (Merriman, 2010: 49). These dynamic urban societies and new urban elites were more open to new ideas because of traders and immigrants. People from different regions came together in the Italian city-states to exchange culture, ideas, beliefs, and intellectual accumulation. Another critical link in this development was the conquest of Istanbul in 1453, which encouraged many Eastern scholars to flee to the Italian peninsula, bringing with them vast collections of ancient books and manuscripts.

    "explanation": "<strong>What did Westphalia result in? How did it influence the international political system?</strong> First, it led to a modicum of religious toleration by reiterating the principle of cuius regio, eius religio, first annunciated at the Peace of Augsburg in 1555. Principalities and other states now had jurisdiction over issues related to religion, and no longer took their cues from the Holy Roman Empire on these matters (Holsti, 1991: 34). More importantly, Europe’s internal wars of religion were by and large over (excepting those against the Ottoman Empire) (Holsti, 1991: 38). Second, and more importantly, the Habsburg family which united Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and many territories in Italy was now divided, as the emperor renounced his right to provide support to Spain (Holsti, 1991: 34-35). It also spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire as a foreign policy-making body. According to these treaties, “the pattern of international relations in Europe was drastically changed: over three hundred political entities were now entitled to conduct foreign relations (make alliances), and the Holy Roman Emperor could not employ force in the conduct of foreign policy, or even make alliances, without the consent of the individual members of the Empire” (Holsti, 1991: 35).

    "explanation": "The spreading tide of Industrial Revolution also transformed the dynamics of the traditional state and the society it governed. Growing numbers of tradable merchandise created a class of investors and merchants, which weakened the older landed aristocracy’s hold on power. Yet apart from this new moneyed aristocracy, a new working class was also emerging. Though the traditional absolutist rule of kings still prevailed, society was dynamically changing. Initially, higher revenues from both domestic and international trade and taxes from increasing production increased kings’ capacity to arm themselves, better govern their realm, and fight wars of territorial acquisition. In the short run, therefore, the Industrial Revolution rocketed the economies of traditional states and transformed them into highly centralized ones. As monarchs made use of their recently acquired means of power for more centralized models of government, the first image of the nation-state in history began to emerge (Hobsbawm, 1962:27-53)."

The Declaration of Independence in 1776 was merely assumed as a crack in the politics of the British Empire, not a social upheaval of subjects against their kings; the role of the American bourgeoisie was neglected. Ratifying its constitution by 1791, the United States of America was declared as a federal republic, announcing a new type of sovereignty based upon the people rather than an absolute monarch.

    "explanation": "In his early reign, Napoleon was lucky to inherit the best military machine in Europe. The French Army was a seasoned fighting force after continuous wars from 1793-1802, and the population of France provided more than enough conscripts motivated by a revolutionary spirit. France’s geographical and historical ties also enabled alliances with smaller states that actively provided men and resources to Napoleon’s campaigns."

Growing numbers of tradable merchandise created a class of investors and merchants, which weakened the older landed aristocracy’s hold on power. Yet apart from this new moneyed aristocracy, a new working class was also emerging. Though the traditional absolutist rule of kings still prevailed, society was dynamically changing. Initially, higher revenues from both domestic and international trade and taxes from increasing production increased kings’ capacity to arm themselves, better govern their realm, and fight wars of territorial acquisition. In the short run, therefore, the Industrial Revolution rocketed the economies of traditional states and transformed them into highly centralized ones. As monarchs made use of their recently acquired means of power for more centralized models of government, the first image of the nation-state in history began to emerge (Hobsbawm, 1962:27-53).

      "E": "American fleet was at a disadvantage."
    },
    "explanation": "In June 1942, in an attempt to divide and destroy the US fleet, the Japanese fleet moved to Midway, eleven hundred miles northwest of Pearl Harbor, while another section sailed toward the Aleutian Islands. However, the American fleet had certain advantages that became crucial in the Battle of Midway. First, the Americans had known the Japanese plans since cracking their naval code. Second, the Americans had radar, which would enable them to forecast Japanese attacks and locate Japanese targets. Third, the Americans had Midway island itself (Rich, 2003:256). On June 4, 1942, the American and Japanese navies entered into a naval battle. As the two fleets were too far from each other, they could not use their big guns or even see each other. Yet American pilots still destroyed four aircraft carriers and downed 322 Japanese planes, gaining superiority over Japanese forces in the process (Perry, et.al. 2008:840). By the end of the battle, the Americans had destroyed Japan’s heavy aircraft carriers, 7 battleships, 12 cruisers, 44 destroyers, and 234 planes (Rich, 2003:257). With the battle of Midway, Japan also seemed to lose its initiative (Perry, et.al., 2008:840). In August, American forces gained beachheads at Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands before moving towards New Guinea. By February 1943 Guadalcanal was retaken by American troops, and New Guinea was recaptured by the end of that year. In October 1943, the Americans won the greatest navalmbattle of the war in the center of the Philippine archipelago (Thomson, 1990:802-803)."

Chaired by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, the Moscow Conference greatly bolstered the Soviet Union’s diplomatic reputation after its military victories against the Germans in Stalingrad and Kursk (Bell, 2011:155).

    "explanation": "It should not be forgotten that the communist victory in the Chinese Civil War (1927-1949) was also one of the most decisive moments of the 20th century. As the end of a huge and immensely important saga that had first seen the country’s two most powerful political movements, the Kuomintang, i.e. Nationalists under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, and the communists, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, briefly aligned (1924-27) in their common effort to root out warlordism before turning viciously against one another (1927-onward), Mao’s victory in 1949 would shape a large part of 20th century global history. Terrifying the American establishment, many of whom now accused Truman of ‘losing China,’ the communist seizure of power in Beijing went a long way toward convincing the Americans, with the UN and many other nations behind them, to go to war in Korea the following year (1950-53). What’s more, Mao’s victory also diluted the USSR’s monopoly on socialist power. With two great eastern states now firmly vying for the position of the world’s ‘most revolutionary,’ the dual nature of the rivalry for world mastery (Moscow vs. Washington) had in some sense now been surpassed."

This new unitary state was called the United Arab Republic with Nasser as its president. Even though the demand for such a merger came from Syria, and the Syrian army pushed forward for it, the UAR dissolved on September 28, 1961, following a Syrian coup d’état.

Moreover, in 1960, the UN General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, through which the UN affirmed that “the right of all people to self-determination” and proclaimed that “colonialism should be brought to a speedy and unconditional end” (UN, 2019). Indeed, the process gained much momentum after the UN’s adoption of this anti-colonial stance. As formerly colonized countries became independent states, they joined the UN, and thus the number of UN members increased from 51 in 1945 to 104 in 1961. By 1961, almost half of the UN member states were formerly colonized countries (Van Langenhove, 1961: 415-416)<br/>The correct answer is E."

    "explanation": "When viewed from the angle of the debates trying to project the future of the new world order, the First Gulf War was important for several reasons. First, this was the first ever that smart bombs had been used, i.e. precision-guided bombs and missiles tuned with incredible accuracy and were very effective in destroying their intended targets and were crucial to the US-led international<br/>coalition’s swift victory. Second, the war coincided with the development of cable news networks whose 24-hour coverage of the war led to the emergence of the CNN Effect. The CNN Effect is the ability of the news media to shape public opinion, including that of public officials, thus influencing major foreign policy decisions. Third, the success of the international coalition, though able to garner a swift victory against Iraq, triggered false hopes about the role of institutions and major powers to act collectively against a common threat in the post-Cold War order.

    },
    "explanation": "Though the signing of the accords garnered Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat, and Shimon Peres the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994, it quickly became clear that they had been stillborn. First, there were groups among both the Palestinians and Israelis that saw the accords as an act of treason. On the Palestinian side, the signing of the accords helped pave the way towards the rise of Hamas, a radical Islamist alternative to PLO that considered the accords an act of treason. On the Israeli side, they lead to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995 by an Israeli extremist, who similarly saw Oslo as caving to Palestinian demands. Second, the accords were unable to stop the violence that both sides were perpetrating against each other, and third, they did not really clarify important issues such as the current and future state of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, the status of Jerusalem, or the repatriation of Palestinian refugees. The final blow to the accords came in September 2000 with the start of the Second Intifada. It was triggered by the ‘visit’ of Ariel Sharon, then leader of the Likud Party, to Haram al-Sharif (the Temple Mount), where he declared the holy site a part of the Jewish state. With that Israeli-Palestinian relations tumbled yet again into a spiral of violence."

In Poland, for example, this transition had already begun in 1980 when a group of Gdansk shipyard workers led by Lech Walesa came together as the Solidarity Movement to protest an increase in food prices. In the face of worsening economic conditions and protests, the authorities cracked down on the movement and jailed its leaders. By early 1989, Poland’s leader General Wojciech Jaruzelski realized that he could not rule the country without the Solidarity Movement, and thus legalized the movement and started a series of round-table talks that led to an elite-led democratic transition in the country. These talks would not only lead to the first competitive elections in the Polish parliament, in which Solidarity would capture the majority of the seats in both houses, but also to the election of the first non-communist prime minister in the Soviet Bloc-Tadeusz Mazowiecki.

In June 1991, Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence, soon followed with Macedonia in September 1991 and Bosnia-Herzegovina in March 1992. e federal army of Yugoslavia initially tried to bring Slovenia and Croatia back into Yugoslavia by force. However, the recognition given to them by European countries and later the US-not to mention the UN peacekeeping forces deployed to monitor the cease re established after the withdrawal of the Yugoslav federal army-gave Belgrade no choice but to let Slovenia and Croatia go. However, when Bosnia-Herzegovina declared independence in March 1992, a move recognized by the EU, Bosnian Serbs led by Radovan Karadzic and supported by Serbia declared the establishment of the Republika Srpska (“Serb Republic”), which left the Muslim Bosniaks, demographically the majority, with a small piece of territory. As this was not enough, to enforce the new Serb Republic, Bosnian Serbs besieged several cities, including the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, and tried to expel the Muslim Bosniak population from their recently created state, a move that eventually led to the creation of concentration camps and much worse- the mass ethnic cleansing of the Bosniaks.

    "explanation": "In 1985, efforts to further “deepen” the European Community had led to the signing of the Single European Act. While envisioning institutional changes that facilitated political integration, this act also agreed to the creation of an economic and monetary union (EMU) as well as to the creation of a ‘single market’ among members by January 1993 in which goods, services, capital and, more importantly, people could move freely. Removing these barriers would be the crowning achievement of the neoliberal economic paradigm that had begun to have its heyday in the 1980s, thus shaping the European Community alongside with the forces of globalization. This tendency to “deepen” was further advanced with the signing of the Treaty of Maastricht in February 1992. First, effective November 1, 1993, not only had the European Community become the European Union, but members of the union had also agreed on creating a single currency, the euro, and a common central bank for what would now be known as the Eurozone. Membership in the Eurozone was not automatic. Only EU members that fulfilled the convergence criteria, i.e. those that had price stability and sound public finances with manageable government deficits and debts and achieved a certain level of stability in their exchange rates and long-term interest rates-were eligible for admittance in the monetary union. When the time came to put the ‘euro’ into circulation in January 2002, however, the convergence criteria was disregarded for certain countries. What is more, others such as Britain, Denmark, and Sweden exercised their right to ‘opt out’ and continue to use their own national currency, further undermining the creation of a full and solid monetary union. Second the Treaty of Maastricht also gave EU citizens the right to work and live in any member country, rendering borders between members obsolete. The correct answer is Choice E."

Defined as <em>perestroika </em>(restructuring), this reform package intended some small scale changes in the country’s economy and politics with the aim of primarily fixing the problems of the Soviet economy. In the realm of the economy, these changes involved reforms such as the introduction of small-scale private economic activity and giving responsibility to factory managers. In the political and social realm, these reforms were known as <em>glasnost </em>(openness) and involved the creation of a more representative system, acknowledging social problems and historical wrongdoings, and intending to give a larger “voice” to people so that they could air their grievances in economically turbulent times.

In a similar tone, and as early as 1989, even before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, <strong>Francis Fukuyama </strong>in his famous article, “<em>The End of History</em>” argued that history was made as a result of the clash between individualism and collectivism, and that the weakening of communist regimes in the USSR and East Europe meant the defeat of the forces of collectivism and the victory of individualism, i.e., liberalism.

Operation Desert Shield, which necessitated a US troop build up in Saudi Arabia and the creation of an international coalition, was the first phase of the war that would eventually drive the Iraqi army out of Kuwait. The second phase of the war, Operation Desert Storm, started on January 16, 1991 when US-led international coalition, following a UN resolution, decided to enforce UN sanctions by military force, beginning with airstrikes against Iraq. These were coupled with a ground force in the final phase of operations. By the end of February 1991, not only was Kuwait liberated, but after a humiliating defeat and withdrawal, Iraq agreed to comply with the UN sanctions. The correct answer is E."

In the face of worsening economic conditions and protests, the authorities cracked down on the movement and jailed its leaders. By early 1989, Poland’s leader General Wojciech Jaruzelski realized that he could not rule the country without the Solidarity Movement, and thus legalized the movement and started a series of round-table talks that led to an elite-led democratic transition in the country. These talks would not only lead to the first competitive elections in the Polish parliament, in which Solidarity would capture the majority of the seats in both houses, but also to the election of the first non-communist prime minister in the Soviet Bloc-Tadeusz Mazowiecki.

    "explanation": "The Arab Spring began in Tunisia in mid-December 2010 when a street vendor named Mohammed Bouzazi burned himself to death in protest over his maltreatment by the Tunisian police. His self-immolation triggered widespread anti-government demonstrations which rapidly brought an end to the 24-year oppressive regime of President Zine-al Abidine Bin-Ali. Anti-government protests quickly spread to other Arab countries from Morocco to Bahraini. Encouraged by the rapid success of the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia, as it became known due to its almost immediate success, protests erupted against the authoritarian government of Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt since 1981. In late January 2011, protestors gathered on Tahrir Square in Cairo to demand Mubarak’s removal. After losing the support of the military, he finally resigned from office on February 11, 2011. <br/>The Arab uprisings did not lead to peaceful changes of regime everywhere, however.

    "explanation": "Globalization is primarily an economic process based on the principles of neoliberal economics and driven by removing barriers to the free circulation of goods, capital, and, to a certain extent, people. Aided by improvements in information technology, globalization is a force with huge political, social, and cultural implications."

    "explanation": "The Iraqi government maintained that historically Kuwait had been a part of Iraq and that Iraq was simply correcting an earlier mistake of the imperialist powers. In reality, reasons for the invasion ran deeper. Indebted and war-ravaged as a result of its eight-year long war with Iran, Iraq’s only way out of debt and a path to reconstruction was the revenue it planned to garner by exporting oil."

    "explanation": "US President George Bush announced Operation Desert Shield on August 7, 1990, arguing that the US imported half of the oil it consumed from the region and that the invasion of Kuwait was a “major threat to its economic independence,” (Bush, 1990). Operation Desert Shield, which necessitated a US troop build up in Saudi Arabia and the creation of an international coalition, was the first phase of the war that would eventually drive the Iraqi army out of Kuwait."

Second, the war coincided with the development of cable news networks whose 24-hour coverage of the war led to the emergence of the CNN Effect."

In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, the BRICS countries have deepened their partnership, and in 2009 their leaders began to hold annual summits."
