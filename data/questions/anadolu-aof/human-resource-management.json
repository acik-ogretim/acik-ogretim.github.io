To conduct an effective human resource planning and to meet the needs of the employees within the framework of this plan requires possessing sufficient knowledge about the quantity, skills, and potentials of the existing human resources. Thus, workforce skills analysis; or in other words, workforce inventory; is a resource that reflects the human resources employed in the organization from various perspectives based on their qualifications. Developing such an inventory provides information about the wage level and quantity of employees in any position in the organization, and their age, gender, seniority, skills, education levels, and potential Furthermore, it attempts to identify the potential abilities and skills of the employees."

    "explanation": "Human resource planning identifies human resources requirements of an organization and supply of human resources. The following describes what is identified by this process:\n Replacement of Persons: there are some reasons as to why large number of human resource is recruited in an organization. These reasons are retirement, old age, death, etc. Recruitment could be from internal resources or from external resources. Although for this two case, human resources should get prepared for the vacancy position.\n Labor Turnover: There is always labor turnover in every organization. The degree of labor turnover may vary from concern to concern but it cannot be eliminated altogether. There will be a need to recruit new persons to take up the positions of those who have left the organization. If the concern is able to forecast the turnover rate precisely, then advance efforts are made to recruit and train persons so that work does not suffer for want of workers.\n Expansion Plans: Businesses always want to expand their activities either national or international. Therefore, they expand their activities, employees, facilities, or earnings. Whenever they decide to expand, they should prepare their employees for this change. Employees need to know that there could be new positions.\n Technological Changes: Rapid developments and advances in technology affect the structural and functional qualities of the organizations and create diversity in the production of goods and services. Due to these developments and advances, several jobs disappear, and several new jobs and occupations emerge. New jobs and tasks that arise due to the rapid technological changes require different types of workforce in the organization.\n Assessing Needs: Human resource planning is not only about finding the right person for the right job, it is also about shortage or excess of employees. If there are less persons than needed, it will affect the work negatively. Human resource planning provides the employment of suitable workforce."

This method depends on the availability of past records and the internal environmental changes likely to occur in future.\n The third method is econometric model.

The internal supply of labor changes regularly because of retiring, resigning, dying, or discharging of employees in the organization. In this context, not only the labor supply but also the skills of the employees change. Employees develop new skills by training, bu work experience, or by displacement. Planners need some methods or systems for internal and future supply of organization. These are skills inventories and human resource systems.\n In short, determination of human resources supply in organizations is the process of determining the qualifications and number of the employees in the organization."

Normal overtime work:</strong> “Overtime work may be performed for purposes such as the country’s interest, the nature of the operation or the need to increase output.” This is defined as normal overtime work (art. 41/1).

Compulsory overtime work:</strong> Compulsory overtime work may be required in the case of an actual or potential malfunction, or in the case of urgent work to be performed on machinery, tools or equipment, or in the case of force majeure. The workers do overtime work until the establishment operates regularly (art. 42). For example, if the establishment was destroyed by force majeure reasons such as earthquake, fire or flood, the employer may require overtime work until the establishment is ready for its normal operation and production. The worker’s approval for overtime work is not required. The duration of overtime work is limited.

The LA envisages to establish a severance pay fund. However, the provisions of severance pay in the previous LA, No: 1475, shall be protected until the enactment of the severance pay fund (transitional art. 6). Due to the lack of regulations on the severance pay fund, article 14 of the LA No: 1475, related to severance pay, is still in force. To be entitled to severance pay, the worker under the protection of the LA must have at least one year service at the same establishment or in other units of the same employer, and the employment contract must have terminated under certain circumstances. Therefore, the correct option is C."

    "explanation": "Page 229<br/>Strike: Industrial action is one of the fundamental means of workers and trade unions to solve labor disputes and promote their economic and social interests. Strike is one of the forms of industrial action that is explicitly recognized in most of the countries. According to the TUCLA, strike “means any concerted cessation by workers of their work with the object of halting the activities of a given establishment or of paralyzing such activities to a considerable extent, or any abandonment by workers of their work in accordance with a decision taken to that effect by an organization” (art. 58/1). Strike is a mechanism to settle the collective labor disputes, not an objective of a trade union.\n During a strike or a lock-out, employment contracts have been suspended, not terminated."
