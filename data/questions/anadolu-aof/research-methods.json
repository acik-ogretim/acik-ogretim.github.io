Because, without a framework for what to observe, that provides guidance for what features to pay attention to, or what to focus on, there are too many things to observe. Any observation statement presumes a theory behind it. In other words, theory-free observations are impossible simply because there are no pure facts to observe; what we call facts are interpreted by us as relevant to our purposes at hand. Thus, any observation statement is necessarily theory-laden, regardless of how purely-factual it appears to be."

    "explanation": "Overtime, the unsolvable problems start growing and anomalies start to accumulate. Even the most brilliant masterminds can’t solve these problems under the current paradigm. When this happens, the field enters into a phase of crisis (C). Only then, the community starts questioning the basic assumptions of their current theory. And, searches began for new ideas, for new ways of approaching problems; and competing schools of thought starts emerging, each offering their own distinctive views on how to deal with these problems. When this happens, the field enters the phase of revolutionary science (R). Revolutionary science is similar to pre-science in that there is a lack of consensus in both phases, because there are rival ideas coming from competing schools of thought. Again, over time, an individual or a group comes up with superior ideas and their ideas begin dominating, thereby paradigm shift (PS) takes place as the previously accepted theory is replaced by a new theory. Thereby, the field enters a next phase of normal science (N2). Thus, theory testing takes place only during revolutionary science. And, science has a cycle from normal science to revolutionary science and back to a new phase of normal science (N2) and to new phase of revolutionary science (R2) and so on. The process moves in a spiral like cyclical process."

In the same vein, what we take as the reality is a representation of the world, because we cannot directly perceive the world (we can directly perceive only our sense data).

That is, our knowledge is induced form particular experiences we have had in the past, and because the future does not have to resemble the past these generalizations are not trust worthy.are Thus, our knowledge based on sense experiences can only give us probabilistic knowledge, which could or could not be true in future experiences.

This random assignment of participants to any of the groups is known as randomization, and placement in any group is a matter of chance. Subsequently, the researcher administers the experimental intervention. In other words, s/he provides the experimental group with relevant stimuli by determining the time, setting, and situation on her/his own. Using this design, the researcher establishes a dependent variable that can be measured both before and after the independent variable is introduced. These are termed as pre-test and post-test measurements, and they indicate if the experimental process has any effect or not. This gauges the effect that the independent variable has over the dependent variable, namely the main focus of that experimental research."

The researcher should assign the participants in each group randomly. Subjects cannot decide which group they are going to be in. This random assignment of participants to any of the groups is known as randomization, and placement in any group is a matter of chance. Subsequently, the researcher administers the experimental intervention. In other words, s/he provides the experimental group with relevant stimuli by determining the time, setting, and situation on her/his own. Using this design, the researcher establishes a dependent variable that can be measured both before and after the independent variable is introduced. These are termed as pre-test and post-test measurements, and they indicate if the experimental process has any effect or not. This gauges the effect that the independent variable has over the dependent variable, namely the main focus of that experimental research."

Thus, a well-defined starting point or rigid procedures that a researcher should follow are not among the properties of a qualitative research process. Rather, it entails a flexible approach, and the research process can be re-arranged depending on circumstances emerging during the research process.

In this regard, action plan can help determine the obstacles preventing members from participating in the democratic processes within the party and increase members’ participation into decision making processes by eliminating those obstacles through planning relevant actions. Action plans and implementation continues until participation is achieved. During drafting an action plan design, a researcher should keep in mind that action plans to be administered should be dynamic and flexible. In other words, a researcher should know that s/he may have to review, and revise action plans depending on their success and develop new action plans from scratch. Moreover, s/he should consider if s/he will include or exclude unforeseen issues pertinent to the research question and emerging during the process."

They can be summarized as follows:<br/>• Indexes - provide citations that fully identify a work with information such as author, titles of a book, article, and/or journal, publisher and publication date, volume and issue number and page numbers.<br/>• Abstracts - summarize the primary or secondary sources<br/>• Databases - are online indexes that usually include abstracts for each primary or secondary resource, and may also include a digital copy of the resource.<br/>The correct answer is Choice A."

Peer-reviewed journal articles published in genuine electronic journals. These should be referenced using their volume number and date, plus the full web address.

If the information is not consistent with the prestigious sources, the author should discuss its reasons. If the accuracy of the web source is uncertain, it should not be preferred.<br/>3. Objectivity. The literature reviewer should be careful about the sponsor’s point of view in case of biased expressions. The website should balance different points of views. Otherwise, it should not be taken as a trusted source.<br/>4. Currency. The website should give information about the uploading date of the document, the beginning and the end of the pages.

    "explanation": "The inadequate training in conducting a literature review leads students learning by themselves, mostly by trial and error method, and this in a number of common problems and mistakes (Baumeister, 2013, 125-129):<br/>1. Uncertain Purpose. The purpose of the study should be made clear not simply by summarizing the past studies or findings. Instead of this, the researcher should contribute to the literature by offering a new and developed understanding related to the selected topic. For this reason, the literature review should be clearly defined with the goal of advancing the field’s theoretical or conceptual knowledge.<br/>2. Vague Introduction and Poor Organization. Many writers have difficulty in following the plan which dictates that the introduction should define the goals clearly and then explain the theoretical framework carefully and thoroughly.<br/>3. Not Enough Information. One of the common mistakes is to fail to present satisfactory information about the literature review. Sometimes authors do not give enough information about how they reach their conclusions. A well-structured literature should make a summary of the methods and findings of the studies cited rather than the conclusions. You do not need to write multiple paragraphs on every reference you cited. But you have to give adequate information to provide the reader to make up their own reasoning whether the arguments make up your conclusions. Sometimes the opposite of this comes to existence. Presenting excessive details is another undesirable situation in literature reviews. The more you write, the more you risk making an error.<br/>4. Failing to Connect to Take-Home Message. The take-home message should move the reader beyond the current state of knowledge on a specific topic by your comments which have the potential to develop the theory. The take-home message is your point of view expressed clearly in general discussion and abstract sections. “The take-home message is the capsule value of your paper, and everything in the paper should refer to it”.<br/>5. Be Critical. Another common mistake is the lack of criticism. In social sciences, every study has a limitation and they should be discussed. The criticism can be performed under the sub-heading such as literature and findings. Your paper’s value will increase if you can discuss the weaknesses and strengths of the evidence you referred. As a researcher/literature reviewer your role is not that of a lawyer who seeks to prove the best case for one side of the argument. Instead, your role is to consider the evidence skeptically like a judge or jury. Another error related to this point is that, some writers fail to be consistent with what they evidenced and concluded. Your conclusions should coincide with the weaknesses and the strengths of what you discussed in the literature, methods, and findings subheadings.<br/>6. Exceptions and Counterexamples. It is important to control the results and conclusions of the biases that ordinary people bear for selective critique of every day processes. The literature reviewer is likely to recognize similar tendencies when a conclusion goes with prevailing wisdom and or seems politically correct. The literature reviewer should avoid such tendencies as far as possible. The literature reviewer should also avoid seeking supportive examples for the research topic. This kind of approach will cause “confirmation bias”. To overcome this threat, the literature reviewer should spend time for inconsistent evidence.<br/>7. Tell the Reader Where to Go. A successful literature review should open up a space for future researchers implying the research priorities. More specifically, the literature reviewer should discuss the strong, weak and ambiguous points of the paper to provide the reader with a focus on these issues in the future research.<br/>8. Matters of Style. One of the critical issues in writing a literature review is following the guidelines and instructions for style. First responsibility of the researcher is citing the author/s and the date of statements in parentheses in the text properly. The format of citing should be correct in terms of referencing style to enable readers to make distinctions about different writers’ thoughts and findings. However, the literature reviewer should not let the names to have a principal position in the paper. One rule of thumb is “Do not start a paragraph with a name!”. <br/>Some other common literature review mistakes referred in the literature are as follows (Roselle and Spray, 2011, 53):<br/>1. Discussing the studies consecutively without making a connection with each other<br/>2. Neglecting to state similar findings of the past research<br/>3. Including the articles that are almost irrelevant to the research questions.<br/>The correct answer is Choice C."

    "explanation": "Be Critical. Another common mistake is the lack of criticism. In social sciences, every study has a limitation and they should be discussed. The criticism can be performed under the sub-heading such as literature and findings. Your paper’s value will increase if you can discuss the weaknesses and strengths of the evidence you referred. As a researcher/literature reviewer your role is not that of a lawyer who seeks to prove the best case for one side of the argument. Instead, your role is to consider the evidence skeptically like a judge or jury. Another error related to this point is that, some writers fail to be consistent with what they evidenced and concluded. Your conclusions should coincide with the weaknesses and the strengths of what you discussed in the literature, methods, and findings subheadings."

Already published journal articles and book chapters that have been posted, usually in PDF format, on an academic’s home page. Check, however, that it is the published version.

Besides, numerous topics keep their popularity within a specific period of date until another era starts with different frameworks and understandings. When considering the literature, it is important to keep its history in mind in case it evolves over time. Such an approach can keep you from engaging in a route that has been rejected in some past era.<br/></li> <li> Axiological knowledge. It can also be called a “theory of experience”. This kind of knowledge is created by practitioners who share their long-term experiences. Axiological knowledge may include important conclusions and generalizations. This kind of literature knowledge does not mean technicalities but the world of practice. So, the literature reviewer should notice the potential use of the axiological knowledge and avoid using it as a theory or prior research.<br/></li> <li> Theoretical and conceptual knowledge. Theoretical and conceptual knowledge is mostly based on the critical analysis of past research. They serve as a construct for further research questions. In other words, theoretical and conceptual knowledge lead and guide wresearchers to generate contemporary construct based on these early investigations and their formulations. Research “not supported with a theory” is generally suspected in academic circles. Thus, researchers should explore the theoretical ground and conceptual framework of the problem they focus on.<br/></li> <li> Prior research studies. Past research findings are essential starting points for any kind of investigation. Prior research studies have the potential to understand the historical evolution of your research problem.<br/></li> <li> Reviews. As can be understood by its name, reviews are based on the criticism of the important studies in a particular field. Reviews are very helpful to researchers in the sense that they gather a lot of specific pieces of research and cast them into frameworks and levels of generalization which may be more useful than the many other types of studies.<br/></li> <li> Academic debate. New lines of research attempts initiate academic debates in the literature. The academic debates may help a researcher to avoid the directions that have been discussed and rejected in scholarly circles. Familiarizing yourself with these six type of knowledge may help you have a good position to start and move forward with your research topic and problem.<br/></li> </ol>"

Researchers are mostly interested in negative experiences for the purpose of improving practices and making them better for next generations. Theories can be used to develop research studies. Even a single study can be the focus of a research to examine its implications.

Narrative inquiry is based on sharing experiences about an event or a chain of events with another or others through any channel of communication.The correct answer is C."

Artifacts refer to object(s) located within the focal context, and somehow, they appeal to the researcher’s interest. These objects may range from things that people in the focal setting use for their daily routines and rituals to a book, chair, or another piece of decoration in the environment (Onwuegbuzie et al., 2010). Some examples of artifacts that can be used for a research within IR can be historical footsteps in a specific region, or ruins of a battlefield and a communal area. If the aim is to conduct a more contemporary research study, then some examples may include the goods that refugees leave behind in their camps during migration.

    "explanation": "For narrative research design, on the other hand, Riessman’s (2005) classification is utilized in general: thematic analysis, structural analysis, interactive analysis, and performative analysis. According to this classification, in thematic analysis, a researcher gathers many narrations and concludes findings by grouping the data conceptually via an inductive approach. As for structural analysis, what matters more than narration is the form of narration, and it is a suitable approach to provide details in case studies and to compare more than one narration. Interactive analysis focuses on the dialogue between the narrator and listener. The focal point of a performative analysis is not the words spoken, but gestures, mimes, and moves accompanying narration, and the effort to convince listeners. The aim of data analysis in grounded theory research is to develop an inductive theory based on the data set. Accordingly, data is analyzed via a process called constant comparison (Glaser and Strauss, 2006), in which the researcher first divides the data set into manageable parts and then compares each part with each other in terms of similarities and differences.

Quantitative research, as part of empirical research, enables to describe populations and phenomena in a detailed tradition based on figures or data, and enables the political scientist to make propositions out of relationships between two or more variables. Observation and experimentation are the strategies that can be employed to test an assumption or a theory. <strong>Observation</strong> is the most used strategy by political scientists for international relations, or other social sciences while <strong>experimentation</strong> is not that commonly used due to its nature of testing. For instance, in experimentation if the political scientist is interested in understanding the relationship of a political theory and humans social well-being, there needs to be two equivalent groups to understand the relationship or to verify the theory. Consequently, experimental research earns to be explained thoroughly and rigorously due to its complex nature of working with humans and the many social, cultural, anthropological, economic, political or historical factors that need to be considered in designing experimental research for social sciences.

Such information about the structure of change helps explain why as well as how changes have occurred over time helps the researcher explain the cause of unexpected fluctuations.

For instance, instance, to understand the attitudes of political participation of university students the researcher only randomly selects students from one province as the available population rather than the whole country to generalize the findings to the target population; • Nonresponse error, which occurs when some particular units of analysis tend to answer some particular items which are likely to influence the estimate of the findings; • Measurement error is described as the difference between the estimate produced and the true value in case the respondents may answer inaccurately to the survey questions.

    "explanation": "Five major standard research objectives are pertinent for the quantitative and qualitative phases of the study: a) exploration, b) description, c) explanation, d) prediction, and/or e) influence. The first type of research objective, exploration, comprises inductive methods to figure out an opinion, argument and the like. In this way, it brings about intuition, hypotheses, deductions or generalization. Description, the second type, means clarifying and defining the previous experiences, relations, and the nature of the incident. One should develop or broaden a theory to achieve ‘explanation’ to find out the phenomena. Another type of research, prediction, enables the researcher to predict future events by means of previous knowledge. The fifth type of objective, influence, includes ‘the manipulation of a variable or construct’ so as to achieve an outcome."

Moreover, it may bring understanding and comprehension that might be missed when only a single method is applied.<br/>• A researcher can also use MMR to increase the generalizability of the results.<br/>• It can be concluded that qualitative and quantitative research blended together create more entire knowledge necessary to notify theory and practice.<br/>On the other hand, conducting mixed methods research has some weaknesses, some of which result from researchers; some of which result from methodology itself. According to Johnson and Christensen, (2004, p. 647) the weaknesses of the MMR are as follows:<br/><ul> <li> A single researcher may have di culty in carrying out both qualitative and quantitative research, especially if two or more approaches are expected to be done concurrently (i.e., the study might require a research team).<br/></li> <li> e researcher has to learn about multiple methods and approaches and understand how to combine them appropriately.<br/></li> <li> Methodological purists contend that one should always work within either a qualitative or quantitative paradigm.<br/></li> <li> It is more expensive.<br/></li> <li> It is more time-consuming.<br/></li> <li> Some of the details of mixed research<br/>remain to be worked out fully by research methodologists (e.g., problems of paradigm mixing, techniques for qualitatively analyzing quantitative data, how to integrate data and inferences, and how to interpret con icting results).<br/></li> </ul> As it can be seen, mixed method is expected to be more expensive than the other research methods.

Conducting various ways of collecting data can support each other and thus strengthens the validity and dependability of the data. Researchers primarily enhance the items of questionnaires regarding the goals and questions of the research. It is a fact that surveys are one of the primary sources of gathering data in any research; on the other hand, it should be assured by the researcher that it is ‘valid, reliable and unambiguous’."

    "explanation": "While writing the MMR report, the researchers can come across possible four problems. These problems can be explained as follows:<br/>1. The researchers may not be able to balance between quantitative and qualitative paradigm;<br/>2. The researchers may not be able to forecast the readers’ quantitative, qualitative and MMR knowledge;<br/>3. The researchers may not be able to summarize big quantitative and qualitative data set in accordance with journal format; and<br/>4. MMR studies may be rejected by the editors or referees, who adopt only one research paradigm.<br/>Presenting the findings in an integrated manner is not a problem but a choice that the writer has to make. The process of writing the MMR report has similar stages to mono method research reports where you ground your study on a single research paradigm ( either entirely quantitative or entirely qualitative). The researchers firstly give the problem, purpose, importance, and method of the study. However, when it comes to writing findings, the researchers have two choices: presenting the two sets of findings and interpretations in separate sections or by fully integrating them in the same section. Then they end up the report by adding conclusion, discussion and suggestions."

Prisoners of war were forced to drink seawater in order to find out how long a man might survive without fresh water.” As a result of such experiments, firstly, the <em>Nuremberg Code </em>of 1947 was developed to outline some basic ethical principles (e.g., informed consent, avoiding harm, respecting privacy) that were anticipated to guide medical experiments. The Nuremberg Code is the most important milestone in research ethics. Because the ethic codes developed in different areas of social sciences were based on the Nuremberg Code."

The Zimbardo Prison Experiment was criticized for not informing participants about the risk of psychological stress, physical discomfort, and/or humiliation to which they were ultimately exposed. The most widely held criticism of the Tuskegee study centers on the absence of informed consent and the exploitation of the participants. The Milgram obedience experiments were conducted to investigate people’s obedience to authority; in other words, the aim was to see how far a person would be willing to harm another person. However, the research participants were deceived about the nature of the research and led to believe that they were administering electric shocks to other participants. In The Little Albert Experiment an 11-month-old infant (named Albert B.), without the knowledge or consent of his parents, was conditioned to fear rats by associating them with fear-inducing circumstances such as a loud noise."

So the main question here is “What should be the priority?”: Aims/intentions for an action/activity (be it evaluation, fishing, or research, etc.) or the results/consequences of that action/activity."

For instance, if the information sheets for informed consent are considered to be too long to read in a reasonable time and too difficult to easily understand, the researchers can be recommended to modify the information sheet at an appropriate reading level. Research shows that, for instance, the information sheets can be too long to be read in a reasonable time and too difficult to be easily understood and that they need to be at a reading grade level of eight or below.

Reflexivity, then, can take many forms.

    "explanation": "According to Lammers and Badia (2004) researchers use two major sampling techniques: probability sampling and nonprobability sampling. With probability sampling, a researcher can specify the probability of an element’s (participant’s) being included in the sample. A probability sampling scheme is one in which every unit in the population has a chance (greater than zero) of being selected in the sample, and this probability can be accurately determined. With nonprobability sampling, there is no way of estimating the probability of an element’s being included in a sample. Any sampling method where some elements of population have no chance of selection (these are sometimes referred to as ‘out of coverage’/’undercovered’), or where the probability of selection can’t be accurately determined If the researcher’s interest is in generalizing the findings derived from the sample to the general population, then probability sampling is far more useful and precise. Unfortunately, it is also much more difficult and expensive than nonprobability sampling."

    "explanation": "When paraphrasing we generally begin the sentence with a signal phrase. When we want to imply that an author ‘argues in favor’, the verb that we use indicates that the source is providing evidence or reason for a position. Common signal phrases in this sense include argues, asserts, contends, demonstrates, holds, illustrates, indicates, ,insists, maintains, shows, supports and proposes. Differs and refutes means ‘argues against’; and determines implies drawing a conclusion from previous discussion."

More than one technique can be employed, the commonest are questionnaires and interviews. Research instruments or measures are the source of the actual data. These can be surveys, interviews, observation and measurement of demographic characteristics (gender, age, height, weight etc.) of the participants. Describing the measure is important because measures are the source of your data. All the results rest on whether or not the measures are adequate, whether measures help the reader judge the validity of the results or not."

In general, we should provide detailed information on the <em>research design/ model</em>, <em>research samples/participants, data gathering instruments/equipment, materials and procedure</em>, <em>validity and reliability of the research instruments </em>and <em>data analysis</em>. The method section should provide enough information to allow other researchers to reproduce our work. In most thesis and articles, the results/findings are presented in a separate chapter/section. A ‘Result’ section that presents key findings emerging from the analysis that answers the research question."
