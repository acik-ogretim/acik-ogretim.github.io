As an author, it will be a practical idea for you<br/>to use as many pronouns as the text allows you. However, do not forget that repeating the same pronoun over and over might also lead to a meaning loss. Therefore, it might be a good idea to refer back to the original noun to make the reader remember<br/>who or what you have been talking about. There are a couple of ways to refer back or forward to another piece of words or phrases in the text. Let’s start with a simple example first:<br/>“Joe and Mary are getting married this weekend.
