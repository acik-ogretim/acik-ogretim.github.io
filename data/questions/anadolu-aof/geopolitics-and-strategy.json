    "explanation": "It was Halford Mackinder who for the first time stated that geography should be analyzed politically as a scientific discipline and thus he was the person who paved the way for the establishment of geopolitics as a distinct discipline.

    },
    "explanation": "Geopolitics does not have a single definition. It is differently defined according to different approaches or world views on the one hand, but on the other the definition has changed throughout the concept’s historical evolution. For Karl Haushofer, the founder of German geopolitics, it was a doctrine that determines all political processes of the state spatially. In Haushofer words, “geopolitics is the new national science of the state, … a doctrine on the spatial determinism of all political processes, based on the broad foundations of geography, especially of political geography.”"

    "explanation": "In 1919 Mackinder re-examined his argument and concluded that his thesis was still valid and applicable. In his new book “Democratic Ideals and Realities” he replaced the term pivot with heartland and expanded its boundaries as to encompass also Eastern and Central Europe. In this work, he also postulated that “Who rules Eastern Europe commands the Heartland. Who rules the Heartland commands the World Island. Who rules the World Island commands the world” (Mackinder, 1942: 106)."

    },
    "explanation": "Ratzel is the first theorist who introduced and used space and location as a means of analyzing the state. For a state, to grow a sufficient life-space (lebensraum) is imperative, therefore in order to grow, states have to expand by changing existing borders. Lebensraum was defined by Ratzel as the geographical surface area required to support a living species at its current population size and as population grew it had to expand. In this sense Lebensraum seemed to place Darwinian natural selection in the spatial and environmental dimensions (Smith, 1980: 53) in the shape of social Darwinism. This theory provided the base for expansionism in foreign policies of states, especially the German state."

    "explanation": "By Rimland theory, Spykman suggested that the key for world domination was passing beyond controlling the coastal lands of Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and China, which he defined as rimland and the rimland includes the heartland as well. In this vein, his formulation like Mackinder’s, came as “who controls the rimland rules Eurasia; who rules Eurasia controls the world.”. The difference of Spykman’s theory from Mackinder’s is that while Mackinder suggested an expansion from the core to the outer area, Spykman claimed that development should extend from the outer area to the inner."

    "explanation": "Since Kennan was a member of the US Department of State during the Truman administration, he could promote the idea of containment. Containment, according to Kennan, is the “application of counter-force at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points, corresponding to the shifts and maneuvers of Soviet policy” (X/Kennan, 1947: 7). The underlying idea here was to prevent the Soviet Union from imposing its ideology on other countries and thus providing economic and military assistance to developing countries could be the main part of the containment policy."

The linchpin states according to Brzezinski at that time were, Germany, Poland, Iran, Afghanistan-Pakistan, South Korea and the Philippines."

These tools are all economic techniques of statecraft, ranging from trade policy to investment policy and from sanctions to foreign aid. However, at this point, some questions arise which blurs the line between military and economic tools. Bombing a factory for example is not geo-economics since bombs are not economic means. But when it comes, for example, to the economic blockades, the case gets confusing. Although blockades are part of military power, they still are economic tools because they should not be engaged only in hot military conflicts. For this reason, blockades can be included within the sphere of geo-ecomics as a means."

With the discovery of new geographies, oceans, peoples, and states, European thinkers became aware of the importance of geography for the strategic and economic benefits of states. The emergence of capitalism in the 16th century, on the other hand, was the main driver for new geopolitical works along with the development of colonialism. In this line, the writings of Jean Bodin (1530 - 1596) are worth mentioning. Bodin followed the ancient idea that the natural environment is a determining factor of human character and he suggested that for establishing the structure and laws of the state, environmental conditions should be taken seriously into account"

The geographical determinism in Montesquieu’s writing has beena phenomenon lasting since Aristoteles in geopolitical or geographical thought and this phenomenon is the main point where geopolitical thinking splits into premodern and modern categories. The pre-modern geopolitical thinking assumes the man as a part of the nature and therefore is not geopolitics in the sense of the word. In other words, what separates modern geopolitical thinking from the premodern one is the assumption that man and nature are distinct and geopolitics as a science aims to reveal and analyse the relationship between them"

In his new book “Democratic Ideals and Realities” he replaced the term pivot with heartland and expanded its boundaries as to encompass also Eastern and Central Europe.

    "explanation": "Another prominent figure of this period is Rudolf Kjellen who coined the term geopolitics. He not only coined the term, but also defined its essence with his emphasis on the physical character, size and relative location of the territory of the state as central to its power position in the international system (Holdar, 1992: 319). According to Kjellen, geopolitics is one of the main disciplines to understand and analyze the state. Other disciplines were ekopolitik for the analysis of the economic structure of the state, demopolitik (etno) which is for population analyses, Sociopolitiks for analyzing the state-society relations and finally kratopolitiks for governmental constitutional politics."

For example, the representation of the Soviet and communist regions as the axis of evil during the Cold War. \n • Core states or hegemonic powers have the privilege to form geopolitical perceptions of the rest of the world. \n • Emphasizing geopolitical differences gives geopolitics a salient role in identity politics. \n Geopolitics as an area of research then owes much to critical geopolitics since it opened a new way of thinking and revealed the underlying assumptions of mainstream geopolitics. However, this does not mean that mainstream geopolitics stopped to produce its traditional analyses in the post-Cold War period.

In December 2008, Russia cut off the gas supply to Ukraine on due to the disagreement of the two on prices and tariffs. When Russian exports to Ukraine were cut off, exports to 16 EU member states and Moldova were first drastically reduced and cut completely from 7 January. This has affected all European countries, but mostly Balkan countries which turned about to be a humanitarian problem. Russia’s use of its economic advantage in this way exposed the power of economic tools in gaining geopolitical benefits and thus intensified the efforts of Europe to diversify away from Russian gas.

The geographical determinism in Montesquieu’s writing has beena phenomenon lasting since Aristoteles in geopolitical or geographical thought and this phenomenon is the main point where geopolitical thinking splits into premodern and modern categories. The pre-modern geopolitical thinking assumes the man as a part of the nature and therefore is not geopolitics in the sense of the word. In other words, what separates modern geopolitical thinking from the premodern one is the assumption that man and nature are distinct and geopolitics as a science aims to reveal and analyse the relationship between them.Therefore, the correct option is B."

The impact of their thought on Nazi Germany’s policies was so decisive and pernicious that geopolitics had been for a long time associated with Hitler’s Germany and considered to be an intellectual exercise serving Hitler’s goals to institute German hegemony across the globe. Rather than geopolitics being recognized as a respectable field of academic study, even the word of geopolitics was avoided in writings on international relations.

Just as individuals require a healthy body and mental condition, states are also in need of fertile and defensible physical terrain as well as robust and uncontaminated people to survive in international politics. The second generation of geopolitical studies came to the fore following the end of the Second World War. It was mainly an ideological competition between liberal capitalist countries of the western bloc and the communist countries of the eastern bloc. Third generation geopolitics began with the end of the Cold War rivalry between two opposing power blocks adopting diverging political ideologies. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the unification of Germany in 1990 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 epitomized the end of ideological geopolitics."

    "explanation": "The second generation of geopolitical studies came to the fore following the end of the Second World War. Throughout the long Cold war years, the US-led Western camp was in bitter ideological competition with the Soviet Union-led eastern camp. The major faultiness between the two opposing power blocks was ideological. The parties competed with each other as to whose political economic model would triumph across the globe. Ideology and identity were the main signifiers of their geopolitical competition. This era in geopolitical studies is also called ideological geopolitics (Gray and Sloan, 2013)."

    "explanation": "Until 2008, the rise of China was not central to American strategic considerations and the European Union was at the apex of its power. The security concepts of Americans and Europeans alike demonstrated optimism and self-confidence in western capitals. Neither the national security strategies adopted by the George W. Bush and Obama administrations in the US nor the firstever security strategy document of the EU adopted in 2003 mentioned great power competition and ideological polarization as potential threats to liberal international world order. Many circles in the West took comfort in Fukuyama’s thesis that the history came to an end with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and with the growing appeal of liberal-capitalist democracy as the only game in town. Fukuyama was basically saying that from the dissolution of the Soviet Union onwards the erstwhile non-capitalist societies would gradually become part of the US-led liberal capitalist world order because the end of the Cold War left them only with this option. The Cold War was decisively won by the liberal capitalist camp and the years ahead would not witness any ideology-driven geopolitical competition among great powers."

Since 2008, there have been disputes all over the world over the values of multiculturalism, openness, tolerance, and universal human rights. The morality of universal cosmopolitanism has gradually given way to the morality of relative communitarianism as rising nonwestern powers, primarily China and Russia, have increasingly offered non-western conceptualizations of international political order."

For example, while first and fourth generation of geopolitical competitions underline the primacy of hard power calculations and behaviors in relational relations, second and third generation of geopolitics tend to put more emphasis on soft power. Critical geopolitics would on the other hand say that it is not easy to separate hard power from soft power and states employ a mix of all power capabilities and relations in their efforts to justify their geopolitical view and claims. That said, a brief discussion on the concept of power would be meaningful in this context."

The way how physical geography is defined requires at the outset a discursive effort. The impact of geography on politics cannot be solely studied in a positivist fashion because statesmen and people who are interested in geopolitics tend to interpret the impact of physical characteristics of geography on politics through their subjective understandings. This suggests that geopolitics as an academic field can best be analyzed through the techniques of critical epistemology and methodology.

    "explanation": "Mackinder, a geographer in the United Kingdom, is considered to be the first important geopolitical thinker. His heartland theory assumes that the particular power that controls the Eurasian landmass would eventually control the global politics and master the universe. In his characterization, land powers are more likely to lay claim to regional and global hegemony than maritime powers. From this perspective all great powers of the time were in a geopolitical competition to ensure that their rivals do not possess full control of the Eurasian landmass. His thoughts seem to have had great impact on Anglo-Saxon geopolitical tradition in that both the British empire during the age of Pax-Britanica and the United States during the age of Pax-Americana spent a good deal of effort to prevent any particular European or Asian country from dominating the Eurasian heartland.\n Unlike Mackinder, Alfred Mahan, a military historian in the United States, argued that the road to global primacy in international politics would go through mastering oceans and other sea lines. He recommended that the leaders of the United States follow in the footsteps of the British Empire to build up a massive naval force if they want to become the most powerful country on earth. Controlling international trade routes at sea would require huge investments in bluewater navy as well as the United States establishing military bases in vital choke points. In Mahan’s thinking, controlling sea traffic through a powerful navy would absolve the United States of taking direct control of other countries. To him, the United States should avoid transforming other nations in the image of American values and stay away from nation-building exercises in far distant places. The United States is already safe because of its territorial location."

So long as the western powers, particularly the United States, assumed that China would turn out to become a responsible stakeholder and gradually transform into a liberal democratic polity, they tolerated China’s rise and its inappropriate trade practices and non-democratic political values. The West was able to endure some economic losses relative to emerging powers, so long as it had self-confidence. The western powers have not been immune to such currents either. The last decade has witnessed the rise of populist and illiberal political movements in key western countries. The internal criticism of liberal democratic practices has severely affected the attractiveness of a liberal world order. As the Brexit decision in the United Kingdom and the election of Donald Trump to presidency in the United States demonstrate, the forces of illiberalism, populism, protectionism, and xenophobia have gained ground in key western countries.

    },
    "explanation": "Geopolitics tries to examine the relationship between geography and politics and ascertains the impact of geographical location and characteristics of states on the interplay of international political competition among them. Throughout history there have occurred different understandings of geopolitics and it is not easy to agree on a common definition of geopolitical thought in the literature (O Tauthail, Dalby, Routledge, 2003). Geopolitics as a unique academic discipline has also close links to International Relations, Security Studies and Strategic Studies. All these academic disciplines share the view that international politics is first and foremost a struggle for power among sovereign nation states. Another close relationship exists between geopolitics and geo-economics. Differentiating between the use of geography for political goals and economic goals is not an easy exercise to do because political and economic motivations of states are very much intermingled with each other. The best example to offer in this regard is China’s One-Road-One-Belt Initiative. The goals of power and wealth maximizations closely relate to each other and most of the time the road to further political power goes through economic power.\n What lies at the roots of geopolitical thinking is the never-ending process of attributing an overarching meaning to physical geography (O Tauthail and Dalby, 2002). The way how physical geography is defined requires at the outset a discursive effort. The impact of geography on politics cannot be solely studied in a positivist fashion because statesmen and people who are interested in geopolitics tend to interpret the impact of physical characteristics of geography on politics through their subjective understandings. This suggests that geopolitics as an academic field can best be analyzed through the techniques of critical epistemology and methodology. The meaning of geopolitics at times when geographical location and physical terrain were too important in the quest of states to maximize their political and economic power was quite different than the meaning of geopolitics at times when technological developments inthe realms of military industry, communication, transportation and information have gradually rendered the mere physical location meaningless in international politics. Since the second half of the nineteenth century till now, the meaning of geopolitics, particularly in regards to what kind of a relationship exists between geography and politics, has varied tremendously.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements in the options related to geopolitics are correct."

His heartland theory assumes that the particular power that controls the Eurasian landmass would eventually control the global politics and master the universe. In his characterization, land powers are more likely to lay claim to regional and global hegemony than maritime powers. From this perspective all great powers of the time were in a geopolitical competition to ensure that their rivals do not possess full control of the Eurasian landmass. His thoughts seem to have had great impact on Anglo-Saxon geopolitical tradition in that both the British empire during the age of Pax-Britanica and the United States during the age of Pax-Americana spent a good deal of effort to prevent any particular European or Asian country from dominating the Eurasian heartland.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

He recommended that the leaders of the United States follow in the footsteps of the British Empire to build up a massive naval force if they want to become the most powerful country on earth. Controlling international trade routes at sea would require huge investments in bluewater navy as well as the United States establishing military bases in vital choke points. In Mahan’s thinking, controlling sea traffic through a powerful navy would absolve the United States of taking direct control of other countries. To him, the United States should avoid transforming other nations in the image of American values and stay away from nation-building exercises in far distant places. The United States is already safe because of its territorial location. The two oceans to its east and west and two weak neighbors to its north and south provide Americans with a high degree of security compared to the nationals of many other countries. Therefore, the American decision makers would do well to invest in navy rather than army. Mahan was of the view that Hamiltonianism would serve American global interests better than other strategies. The best the US should do was to become a role model for others and engage in international trade. If push comes to shove the powerful American navy would protect the American populace and American trade interests across the globe.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

    "explanation": "Geopolitics in its early stages was closely associated with Germany’s foreign policy practices, a latecomer in the struggle for building colonial empires across the globe (Dodds, 2007). Friedrich Ratzel and Karl Haushofer are the most notable German geopolitical thinkers and their thoughts on geopolitics profoundly shaped foreign policies of Nazi Germany during the interwar years and Second World War. The impact of their thought on Nazi Germany’s policies was so decisive and pernicious that geopolitics had been for a long time associated with Hitler’s Germany and considered to be an intellectual exercise serving Hitler’s goals to institute German hegemony across the globe. Rather than geopolitics being recognized as a respectable field of academic study, even the word of geopolitics was avoided in writings on international relations. Hitler’s policies gave a bad reputation to geopolitics. It took some time to recognize geopolitics as a distinct academic discipline.\n To Ratzel and Houshofer, states are like living organisms that require lebensraum, viz. living spaces, to survive in the anarchical international environment. Just as individuals require a healthy body and mental condition, states are also in need of fertile and defensible physical terrain as well as robust and uncontaminated people to survive in international politics. Darwin’s survival of the fittest characterization of interpersonal relations would apply to interstate relations quite well. Hitler carried such thoughts one step further in arguing that the German/Arian race is superior to all other races and its purity needs to be ensured through the elimination of Jews, transsexuals and gypsies from the German nation. Hitler’s geopolitical thinking was also informed by the idea that all ethnic Germans should be brought together under the rule of German state. Such thinking on the part of Hitler’s Nazi government pushed Germany to invade neighboring countries one by one and then organize a massive attack against the Soviet Union during the Second World War. The concentration camps constructed by Nazi Germany across Europe were used to undertake a massive genocide against Jews.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements in the options related to geopolitics in early stages are correct."

The way how each camp approached the issues of armament, development, industrialization, human rights and security was profoundly influenced by their ideological positions. For example, the containment policy that was initially put into existence by the US-led western camp in order to prevent the Soviet Union from physically dominating particular geographical locations reflected ideational motivations in the background. At stake was not only containing the physicalSoviet penetration into some geographical locations but also ensuring that Soviet ideology did not enlarge to those locations. Geographical regions were attributed identity related ideological meanings. To be a part of the west meant not only having military cooperation with the United States multilaterally or bilaterally but also subscribing to the constitutive norms of the western international society.

    "explanation": "During the Cold War era, both the United States and the Soviet Union did their best to increase the number of countries adopting their political ideologies. Their goal was to help enlarge their ideological sphere of influence. A more recent example of ideological geopolitics has taken place over the last decade when the illiberal authoritarian model of China and Russia appears to have dented the image of liberal democracy in the West. Even though the emerging geopolitical rivalry between today’s United States and China can in no way be compared to the ideological rivalry between the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War era, it would not be wrong to argue that the emerging geopolitical competition between Beijing and Washington does also demonstrate diverging normative understandings of political and economic values. A growing number of analysts and observers point out that the United States would do well to help bring into existence a league of liberal democracies if she wanted to contain the rise of China in global politics. It is not a coincidence that all the major powers in Asia that feel themselves threatened by China’s rise are democracies. The members of Quad are all democracies in different shades.\n From a similar perspective, China and Russia have been supporting particular political parties and movements across the world that all appear to hold extremely critical views on multiculturalism, immigration, multilateralism and liberal democracy. Today’s Russia and China appear to excel in authoritarianism and state-led capitalism. Even though Trump’s America is fast moving in the direction of illiberal democracy, it would not be wrong to argue that the escalating geopolitical competition between the United States on the one hand and China and Russia on the other demonstrates strong ideological characteristics. After all what is at stake in this emerging rivalry is whether the liberal-democratic capitalist model will defeat the illiberal authoritarian model in the quest for economic development and political maturation.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the unification of Germany in 1990 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 epitomized the end of ideological geopolitics. Since the early 1990s till the end of the first decade of the twenty first century, analysts observed the rise of a new geopolitical understanding being defined by many as a new world order. New world order geopolitics suggested that there was only one super power all over the world and all other states would gain influence in international politics in relation to the status of their relationship with the global hegemon. That sole superpower happened to be the United States. There was a huge power gap between the United States and all other countries and it was nearly impossible for any country, acting alone or in cooperation with others, to counterbalance the American hegemony. Hence, bandwagoning appears to have replaced balancing in the age American primacy in global politics.\n As also understood from the informaation given, the answer is E.

    "explanation": "The extreme self-confidence on the part of the American statesmen led them to argue that the United States is the indispensable nation and there is no need to help bring into existence new regional or global security organizations that would potentially replace NATO. It was in accordance with such thinking that whenever the Russian leadership offered the idea that a new pan-European security organization should be founded replacing western-dominated ones, the Americans simply ignored them.\n A cardinal characteristic of the third generation geopolitics was that the possibility of any great power war would be almost zero because it was assumed that all great powers would pay an utmost care to get along with the United States well. Just because none of the great powers was in a position to challenge the American preeminence and lay claim to hegemony in its own region, the best thing to do on their side would be bandwagoning with the sole superpower.\n Looking from this perspective, armed conflicts would rather take place within states. Intrastate wars, viz. civil wars, would replace interstate wars. The wars in the Balkans and the Caucasus during the 1990s demonstrated that the major threats to regional and global security would stem from internal conflicts rather than interstate power competitions. During this time period many states across the globe, saving the United States, decreased their military spending in proportion to their Cold War era spending and armies went through a transformation process thereby their peacekeeping and peacemaking capabilities improved.\n This time period also attested to the heyday of the European Union integration process. The EU both enlarged horizontally and deepened vertically. Many countries around the globe looked to the European Union integration process as the ideal example to emulate. EU appeared to be a successful role model for other countries across the globe. New world order geopolitics suggested that American hegemony would keep the peace in the world and other countries would be able to devote much more energy and capital to their economic development and political maturation in line with liberal democratic capitalist values.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements above related to third generation of geopolitics are correct."

    "explanation": "Fourth Generation of Geopolitcs\n Even though the 9/11 attacks on the US homeland dented the image of the United States as the omnipotent global hegemon and criticisms of the American approach to the global war on terror intensified following the US occupation of Iraq, it was primarily following the financial crisis of the late 2000s that a sense of decline began to percolate down to the western elites in the United States and EU members.\n After the 9/11 Attacks\n Not only has the feeling of optimism eroded but also the specter of non-western powers challenging the primacy of western powers has begun to haunt many westerners. As the Russian resurgence and Chinese revival took root, the calls for accommodating rising non-western powers in the institutional structure of the liberal international order began to be heard more loudly (Guzzini, 2012). The revised security strategy of the European Union (issued in the summer of the 2016), and the first national security strategy of the Trump administration (issued in December 2017) demonstrate that western powers feel threatened by the rise of non-western powers. Both documents suggest some ways to deal with the resurgence of traditional security concerns as well as the worldwide emergence of illiberal authoritarianism. Since 2008 there have been disputes all over the world over the values of multiculturalism, openness, tolerance, and universal human rights. The morality of universal cosmopolitanism has gradually given way to the morality of relative communitarianism as rising non-western powers, primarily China and Russia, have increasingly offered non-western conceptualizations of international political order. Non-interference in states’ internal affairs, primacy of state sovereignty, authoritarian leadership, the strengthening of national identities, state-led capitalism, spheres of influence mentality, multi-polarism in global governance, primacy of great powers in international relations, mercantilist trade practices, investment in military power capabilities, an increased use of economic power instruments in the name of securing geopolitical gains, and the questioning of the principle ‘responsibility to protect’ are some of the points that Russian and Chinese leaderships have been vehemently prioritizing over the last decade. This does not, however, suggest that countries like China have not benefited from the liberal international order, particularly in the field of economics. Yet, China’s gains from the liberal-capitalist global order have mainly emanated from western sponsorship, rather than from China acting as a convicted disciple. So long as the western powers, particularly the United States, assumed that China would turn out to become a responsible stakeholder and gradually transform into a liberal democratic polity, they tolerated China’s rise and its inappropriate trade practices and non-democratic political values. The West was able to endure some economic losses relative to emerging powers, so long as it had self-confidence. The western powers have not been immune to such currents either. The last decade has witnessed the rise of populist and illiberal political movements in key western countries. The internal criticism of liberal democratic practices has severely affected the attractiveness of a liberal world order. As the Brexit decision in the United Kingdom and the election of Donald Trump to presidency in the United States demonstrate, the forces of illiberalism, populism, protectionism, and xenophobia have gained ground in key western countries. Parallel to the shift in material power capabilities across the globe and the growing challenges posed to the normative foundation of the liberal international order, realpolitik foreign policy practices and pragmatic concerns in defining national interests have become more pronounced than moralpolitik practices and normative concerns (Nye, 2015). Power politics and ‘sphere of influence’ mentality have experienced a revival over the last decade. As geo-economic and geopolitical motivations have become more decisive in states’ foreign policies, the dynamics of alliance relationships have also gone through a radical transformation. During the last decade, long-term identity based alliance relationships have been replaced with short-term, pragmatic, and issueoriented strategic partnerships. The practice of forming interest-oriented cooperation initiatives within multilateral and bilateral frameworks has gained ground in recent years. In today’s world, countries of different value orientations, geographical locations, power capabilities, and threat perceptions are no longer bound to define each other categorically as enemies or friends. The notion of ‘frenemy’ has already become an identity signifier in interstate relations. The practice of coalitions defining missions has gradually given way to the practice of missions defining coalitions. As opposed to Cold War bipolarity and the unipolar order during the first two decades of the post-Cold War era, the practice of illiberal authoritarian states engaging in pragmatic outcome-oriented cooperation with liberal-minded states is now conceivable.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements in the options related to fourth generation of geopolitics are correct."

    "explanation": "Critical Geopolitics\n The word ‘geopolitics’ consists of two different words. ‘Geo’ is the abbreviation of geography. Politics means deciding who gets what, how and when. Geography consists of two words, geo and graphy. Geo means earth and graphy means writing. Geopolitics means the politics of writing the earth. The fundamental claim of critical geopolitical studies is that all kinds of geopolitical understandings are subjective and reflect particular values and previously conceived national interests. There is not an objective scientific understanding of geopolitics as claimed by first generation geopolitical writers. Naming particular physical locations as they are and attributing meanings to geographical locations are all political exercises in the background. There is not a bird-view of geopolitics which is claimed to be timeless and ahistorical.\n Geopolitics and Power Relations\n From the perspective of critical geopolitics, meanings attributed to particular geographical locations emanate from deeply held political interests and subjective understandings of identity (O Tuathail, 1996). Power relations determine purchasing value of geopolitical understandings. Throughout history different meanings have been attributed to geographical sites. The question to be asked, from the perspective of critical geopolitics, should be which political interests are cloaked under particular geopolitical conceptualizations at different times. Identifying a physical place on earth with particular national interests, identities, ideologies or civilizations is in fact a political exercise. The question of whose geopolitical imagination will prevail in the final analysis will be profoundly determined by the distribution of power capabilities within the international system. All claims to objective geopolitical analyses in fact mask particular political motivations and interests (Ingram and Dodds, 2009). To give an example, one can underline the fact that many people in the world today call the place Middle East as Middle East without thinking any moment why this region is called Middle East. Which actors first depicted this region as such and for which particular purposes? Critical geopolitics as a subfield of geopolitics tries to uncover hidden political purposes and motivations lying behind allegedly objective and neutral geopolitical observations. From the perspective of critical geopolitics, there are no objective geopolitical claims. All such claims are for someone and for some purposes.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

There is not a bird-view of geopolitics which is claimed to be timeless and ahistorical."

    },
    "explanation": "Geopolitical understandings of different time periods tend to demonstrate diverging conceptualizations of power. Power is closely related to geopolitics. For example, while first and fourth generation of geopolitical competitions underline the primacy of hard power calculations and behaviors in relational relations, second and third generation of geopolitics tend to put more emphasis on soft power. Critical geopolitics would on the other hand say that it is not easy to separate hard power from soft power and states employ a mix of all power capabilities and relations in their efforts to justify their geopolitical view and claims. That said, a brief discussion on the concept of power would be meaningful in this context.\n The concept of power is one of the most popular and elusive concepts in the academic discipline of International Relations (Nye, 2011). To many, power is the ability of one actor to influence the behavior, interests and identity of other actors in the image of its own priorities, preferences and values. Put differently, power is the ability of one actor to get what it wants from others. The crux of the issue here is to define from where this ability comes and whether one can measure it. This suggests that power has both residual and relational aspects. Power is residual because being powerful requires a particular state to possess both some capabilities, of both tangible and intangible sorts, and the will to use them in order to have an impact on others. Without those capabilities at the first instance and the will in the background, it is nearly impossible to influence others. Tangible sources are those that can be quantified, measured, observed and categorized. Such sources are military capability, economic might, geographical location, population number, human development, technological prowess, environmental factors, and etc. Intangible sources of power are those that cannot be easily observed, tested or measured. Values, norms, societal cohesion, culture, image and identity are typical examples of intangible power capabilities.\n Power is also relational because for power to exist there needs to be at least two actors interacting with each other. For example, if the state B does not meet the demands of the state A or change its behaviors along the expectations of the State A, the state A does not have power over the state B. Possessing mere power capabilities and the will to use them does not automatically translate into being powerful. Being powerful requires the compliance of others with the demands of the state that tries to have an impact on their choices.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements in the options related to power and geopolitics are correct."

Even though many of such states can be found at fringes of international politics, it is extremely difficult to put a particular state into this category because even the status-quo oriented states have to play by the rules of power politics and engage others instrumentally to protect what they possess at a given time.\n On the other hand, some states have a much broader definition of national interests. Such states tend to have aspirations transcending their national orders. They are risk-takers in that they try to help bring into existence a new power configuration within the existing system so that they find themselves in a much better and prestigious position than before. Whereas some status-quo changer states are only concerned with having an impact on foreign policy behaviors of other states, some others would be very much preoccupied with the projection and promotion of their values and norms onto others. The status-quo changer states prioritizing foreign policy behaviors of others would primarily focus on increasing their material power capabilities vis-a-vis others. At stake for them is the material distribution of power capabilities within the system at a given time. The status-quo changer states trying to project their values and norms onto others would on the other hand be profoundly concerned with the normative foundations of the system. They would hold that their power over others would positively vary with their ability to help transform them in the image of their values and norms. In this sense, status-quo changer states of this kind are all normative powers in that they try to achieve their goals by projecting and expanding their norms onto others.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements in the options related to status-quo changer states are correct. All great powers, such as the United States, China, Russia and the European Union, are normative powers. The countries that wish to have regional spheres of influence are also within this camp. For example, following its ascendance to the top position of international power hierarchy, the United States has put the transformation of international politics in line with American values and standards at the center of its foreign policy. Similarly, the ongoing discussions on rising powers make it explicitly clear that those states are status-quo changer states because they put a strong challenge to the privileged position of western actors within the existing global order, both materially and normatively."

    "explanation": "As a general rule, a state with a large territory may become a candidate of big power in case it fulfills other requirements as well. In other words, a large territory is an attribute of a big power, a mid-size territory is of a middle power. This is why, say, The Netherlands, a prosperous and wealthy state with a relatively tiny territory, is unable to move to the ranks of big powers. It should be recalled that the Dutch Empire, predecessor of The Netherlands, is cited as a major power in history because of its influence in international trade which was made possible thanks to its colonies. Thus, the reason today The Netherlands is not one of the big powers in international politics is because it does not have political control over large territories. On the other hand, Russia which, as opposed to The Netherlands, is relatively unstable in economic terms is considered a big power because of its military influence, and its vast geography. India is even a more illustrative case. Often associated with poverty and social instability, India is often regarded as a rising power which, probably for this reason, seeks permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council. The reason India is categorized as a rising power is its large territory and population."

As an autonomous field, geopolitics now relies on different aspects and components of political geography and also pay attention to the debates and outcomes in other fields for a coherent analysis. In its new form, geopolitics help students, scholars and practitioners run predictions on the future course and trajectory of the international political system and develop strong and firm strategic simulations for the potential actions of the individual states and alliances. The potential successful performance attached to geopolitics is relevant to the growing number of elements, interacting with each other, it takes into calculation when assessing the political value and impact of the geography.

In other words, it is fair to argue that geopolitics has served as the basis and foundation that helped IR scholars better understand and explain the political aspects of the world and conceptualize the interstate affairs. Geopolitical references in the study of international relations have been the norm in many scholarly accounts; more importantly, early theoretical premises seeking to offer a generalizable framework for international politics have heavily relied on assumptions of geopolitics and geopolitical considerations as a whole. For instance, Realism, considered the theory of the IR for a long time, places a great emphasis upon, among other concepts, the term geopolitics which, according to the Realist scholars, holds the potential of properly explaining the root causes of perpetual conflicts between states. For sure, it is no surprise that early IR scholars and theories make much use of geopolitics in their analyses and approaches given that international relations have long been defined in terms of power struggle which eventually makes sense only if territorial gains are examined. Relevance and significance of geopolitics in early stages of the IR as a discipline become more visible when the fact that the IR has evolved out of considerations to put an end to the state of constant warfare is underlined more in stronger terms. In other words, the IR emerged as a response to the challenges posed by the interstate struggle for power which is best reflected in territorial interventions including most notably invasion and conquests which obviously bear relevance only when they are associated with the understanding of geopolitics.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements related to the dynamics of geopolitics in a changing environment of global politics and its relevance to the premises of globalization in the options are correct."

According to Montevideo Convention which sets out the parameters of a state spells out four aspects for a political entity to be properly called a state: defined territory, permanent people, centralized authority and sovereignty. All these aspects and characteristics are basic criteria to define the modern nation state and to distinguish it from other political entities. Both “defined” and “territory” in the term defined territory deserve close attention as they bear significance for a proper definition. Territory refers to a physical space, mostly to land. But it should be noted that territory is not an ordinary type of land and that it is a qualified and political component. As a physical space, territory is an integral element of the state which cannot possibly be separated from it.\n Because it is different from an ordinary type of land, territory appears to be a significant criterion to define the state. For this reason, to make distinction between the modern nation state and the states before the arrival of nation state, the first is also referred to as territorial state. The difference is that in the definition of modern nation state, physical space is attributed to the state as an integral and indispensable element. In other words, only a state has territory which holds a political connotation and implies a monopolistic political control. In other words, a state, by definition and out of legal necessity, has to have a territory; and it is not possible to speak of a state without a defined territory.\n Additionally, only one state has monopoly and control over a territory; therefore, there is connection between territory and the exclusive jurisdiction of a state. This jurisdiction and monopolistic authority by a state over a certain territory is assured under international law which, by the cardinal principle of non-intervention, protects the territorial integrity of all sovereign states. This means that territory, associated with the state and considered an inseparable part of it, is legally protected and that violations directed against its integrity lead to legal responsibility. Thus, it is fair to argue that territory holds a political, as well as legal meaning. “Defined” complements the nature of protection and certainty ascribed to the territory under international law. “Defined territory” implies that the borders of a state are properly identified and ascertained and that their inviolability is stressed and protected by the community of states. The borders of nation states are specified with utmost certainty, often by imagined lines that exist as constructions. Ideally, natural sites are taken as points of references; but legally speaking, they are not the borders. So, it is reasonable to take a mountain that separates two states as point of reference in identifying the borders.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements above related to the concept of defined territory are correct."

    "explanation": "Diversification and complexity in the international affairs further led to specialization and compartmentalization in the definitions and the contents of other relevant areas and disciplines, including geopolitics. By nature, geopolitics is already associated with a number of relevant fields; but this connection and association became stronger in the era of globalization. While this could be an asset for the discipline itself, divisions have also emerged among analysts studying different aspects of geopolitics. For instance, who study the classical geopolitics, placing emphasis upon the deterministic nature of geography, are of the view that the field focuses on space, land, water and outer space because these are the vital elements for the political supremacy in the world (Cohen, 1964). For others, geopolitics is a research field that pays particular attention to not only geography but also dynamics leading up to clashes and rivalries between great powers. In fact, this is how particular strands of geopolitics came into life: the geopolitics of oil (Klare, 2009), the geopolitics of religion (Dijkink, 2006), the geopolitics of water (Selby, 2005), the geopolitics of propaganda and the geopolitics of internet (Hlihor, 2014).\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

    "explanation": "In case the community of states has developed common agreements and strong norms, sovereignty is transformed into a source of responsibility. The term responsible sovereignty refers to this novel advancement in the understanding of international politics (KiMoon, 2008). Responsible sovereignty is based on a prior idea of sovereignty as responsibility which deals with the notion of sovereignty from a normative perspective rather than a free pass for the independent states in the conduct of their foreign policies (Deng et al., 1996). This approach suggests that a state is responsible vis-à-vis its people in terms of honoring the universal human rights rules in all practices and actions and complying with its international legal and moral obligations. More concretely, the minimum requirement of fulfilling this responsibility is to comply with the humanitarian norms for legitimacy, to build capacity in an effort to protect the people against severe threats and to offer proper conditions for their survival and betterment (Falk, 2000: 60-65). Sovereignty as responsibility led to the emergence of the concept of human security which is based on the recognition of freedom from fear, freedom from want and human dignity (Gasper and Gomez, 2015).\n As also udnerstood from the information given, the answer is E.

Some of these factors might be controllable or changeable through implementation of certain policies, especially by use of innovative tools in this age of information and globalization whereas some others remain as constant and unchangeable. Innovative strategies, for instance, might be devised to make better use of natural resources which could be made an integral part of a coherent policy of industrialization and development. On the other hand, geopolitical disadvantages associated with being located in a fairly precarious area might be addressed by a constructive policy vis-à-vis the neighboring states."

For this reason, to make distinction between the modern nation state and the states before the arrival of nation state, the first is also referred to as territorial state. The difference is that in the definition of modern nation state, physical space is attributed to the state as an integral and indispensable element. In other words, only a state has territory which holds a political connotation and implies a monopolistic political control. In other words, a state, by definition and out of legal necessity, has to have a territory; and it is not possible to speak of a state without a defined territory. The answer is A."

First used in 1986, it is fairly difficult to define the term globalization. In defining this term, some scholars place emphasis upon multinational enterprises and information technology as driving forces of the process, as well as their global impacts. Market economy plays a determinative role in economic globalization: “[t]he market economy has conquered all over the world. Ten years ago, less than 1 billion people were living in market economies. Now that number is 5 billion. This is the phenomenon called globalization.”. This definition focuses on the economic dimension of globalization only.

Like Fukuyama, Huntington also agrees that the Cold War ended with the indisputable victory of the Western liberal democracy but further recalls that rivalry will not be replaced by permanent and lasting peace just because of that victory.

By nature, geopolitics is already associated with a number of relevant fields; but this connection and association became stronger in the era of globalization. While this could be an asset for the discipline itself, divisions have also emerged among analysts studying different aspects of geopolitics. For instance, who study the classical geopolitics, placing emphasis upon the deterministic nature of geography, are of the view that the field focuses on space, land, water and outer space because these are the vital elements for the political supremacy in the world (Cohen, 1964). For others, geopolitics is a research field that pays particular attention to not only geography but also dynamics leading up to clashes and rivalries between great powers. In fact, this is how particular strands of geopolitics came into life: the geopolitics of oil (Klare, 2009), the geopolitics of religion (Dijkink, 2006), the geopolitics of water (Selby, 2005), the geopolitics of propaganda and the geopolitics of internet (Hlihor, 2014).

This approach further stressed that ideology was no longer a determinative tool in interstate politics and that economic rivalry would become the main dynamic in international affairs.

For centuries, the diversity of people living in the region has been both a source of conflict and of cultural enrichment. Since Antiquity, when Jason and Argonauts went to its shores to search for Golden Fleece, it attracted wider European attention. It had been, from Antiquity to the end of the 20th century, a backyard of one power or the other; otherwise witnessed their competition to dominate it. It saw the dominance of the Byzantine, Ottoman, and finally Russian Empires that successfully closed it to the outside world for a number of years. During the most of the 18th and 19th centuries, the Black Sea saw a struggle for supremacy over the sea between the Ottoman Empire and Czarist Russia. In fact, the control over the Turkish Straits, which links the Black Sea to the open seas, was one of the most influential determining factors shaping the alliances in world politics. Supremacy over the Black Sea was the main reason behind the Crimean War of 1856 and struggle to control the Straits created one of the most memorable battles of the First World War. Similar situation existed during the Second World War and after that during the Cold War. Russian maneuvering to gain control over the Straits, or at least to share their responsibility, during the Second World War had induced Turkey to seek membership in the NATO, thus bringing the latter to the region."

In 1960s, after the large oil reserves are discovered in the North Sea, the Dutch oil exports increased on a vast scale. Despite the positive development, there were serious consequences on important segments of the Dutch economy as the Dutch guilder (former currency of the Netherlands) became stronger. Non-oil exports became more expensive and therefore less competitive. Moreover, between 1970 and 1977, the unemployment rates increased from 1,1% to 5,1%. Since the oil and gas extraction are capital-intense businesses, they generate few jobs. This situation occurred in many countries across the world. The Dutch disease is generally linked to a natural resource discovery but it can be related to the any sector in which there is an unexpected high increase that causes a decline in other sectors."

While the Caucasian countries had experiences of statehood before finally subjugated to the Russian/Soviet rule in the early 20th century and Moldova had a very brief independence in 1918, Central Asian countries as well as Ukraine had never in history experienced with a modern state system and did not exist in the forms that they gained their independence at the end of the 20th century.

It had been, from Antiquity to the end of the 20th century, a backyard of one power or the other; otherwise witnessed their competition to dominate it.

    "explanation": "Eurasia is a vast region, stretching from eastern Europe in the West to the Wall of China in the East. Its western parts has had a specific role in the development of geopolitical analysis. What Alfred Mackinder called struggle to control over the “pivot” in 1904 in a paper submitted to Royal Geographical Society, later came to dominate the geopolitical understanding of the great powers of the time and much later the superpowers of the Cold War era. Simply put, according to Mackinder, whoever controls the Eastern Europe controls the Heartland, moving ahead in the quest to achieve world dominance. The answer is B."

    },
    "explanation": "From a contemporary geopolitical perspective, the Caucasus is the region between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea and comprised of Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, though the parts of Russia, Turkey and Iran could be included from a geographic standpoint. The Caucasus Mountains, where Europe and Asia converge, separates the North Caucasus, which is made up of Krasnodar Krai, Stavropol Krai and autonomous republics of Adygea, Karachi-Cherkassy, Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia-Alania, Ingushetia, Chechnya and Dagestan within the Russian Federation, and the South Caucasus of three independent Caucasian countries. The latter was called Trans-Caucasus (Zakavkáz’je in Russian) in history from a Russian perspective, meaning the region “beyond the Caucasus Mountains”. The Caucasus Mountain range is actually made up of two ranges of mountains; the Greater Caucasus in the north and the Lesser Caucasus in the south. The watershed of the Greater Caucasus has traditionally accepted as dividing point between Europe and Asia. Consequently, while some analysts put the western portion of the Caucasus region in Europe and the eastern part (the majority of Azerbaijan and small parts of Armenia, Georgia, and Russia’s Caspian Sea coast) in Asia, some others identify the Aras River on the border of Turkey as the continental demarcation line that presents Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia in Europe.

    "explanation": "Dutch Disease: It is a term coined by the Economist in 1977 to describe the problems of the Dutch economy related to its one-product economy. In 1960s, after the large oil reserves are discovered in the North Sea, the Dutch oil exports increased on a vast scale. Despite the positive development, there were serious consequences on important segments of the Dutch economy as the Dutch guilder (former currency of the Netherlands) became stronger. Non-oil exports became more expensive and therefore less competitive. Moreover, between 1970 and 1977, the unemployment rates increased from 1,1% to 5,1%. Since the oil and gas extraction are capital-intense businesses, they generate few jobs. This situation occurred in many countries across the world. The Dutch disease is generally linked to a natural resource discovery but it can be related to the any sector in which there is an unexpected high increase that causes a decline in other sectors.

Due to the long-term destruction of environmental norms and lack of control over oil explorations, the environmental problems have aggravated since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Together with the rising sea level and the flooding of coastal areas, there are problems related to increasing saturation and greasiness of the soil that depleted fisheries in the Caspian Sea. Another long term environmental disaster in the region is the continuing destruction of the Lake Aral. It was the gigantic diversion projects of the various rivers that flew to the Lake Aral during the Soviet period to support cotton production in Uzbekistan that cut the natural flow of water into the Lake and started desertification of its shorelands. In addition, the industrial waste that was carried to the Lake with rivers thoroughly polluted water reservoir of the Lake. Today, almost %80 percent of the Lake Aral’s body of water have disappeared and the Lake is essentially divided into three smaller dirty water reservoirs. The answer is A."

Despite the fact that it was started during the Carter period, the term was officially used for the first time by Martin Indyk, the Special Assistant to the President and National Security Council, during the Clinton administration in 1994. The implementation of the policy was different for Iran and Iraq since their characteristics were different. However, the common idea was to isolate both countries regionally and to exclude them from the world economic and trading system. The case of Iraq was multilateral that included the economic and military sanctions against Iraq by the UN. In addition to the sanctions, the overthrowing of the Saddam regime was the extension of this policy.

The uncertainty caused by the economic, social and political crisis limited most of the Russian objectives toward these countries in the early 1990s. Therefore, Russia developed “new abroad” policy mainly to watch over the situation of the ethnic Russians living in the newly independent states in 1990s. Originally, the main concern of Russia was about the level of influence it would obtain in these countries through ethnic Russian populations living in these countries. After 1994, it came to denote wider Russian political, economic, and other attempts to recover its earlier (i.e. Soviet era) influential position in these countries. The answer is E."

    "explanation": "Despite the unfavorable perception of geopolitics by European states and peoples because of its past links with imperialism, nationalism and fascism, geography has always played a central role in determining the internal and external borders of Europe, as well as the design and conduct of European integration.\n Geopolitics is not a popular term in Europe despite the fact that earlier geopolitical theories originated there during the second half of 19th century and onwards. Specifically, these theories have been associated with militarism, nationalism and fascism in the early 20th century and then linked theoretically with the Realist school of international relations. Thus the concept of geopolitics has been largely unpopular in Europe, while the arrival of European integration has only consolidated this unfavorable view, since the idea of a supranational union was conceived as an antidote to geopolitical thinking, and hence the EU gained a reputation as an anti-geopolitical entity. With its characteristics of normative and civilian power, the EU experience in foreign policy is not coherent with classical geopolitical thought, either. On the other hand, such breaking points in recent political history as the end of the Cold War, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Ukraine Crisis, has led to the resurgence of geopolitics and geopolitical thinking in European politics, and have posed a great and disturbing challenge for the EU’s normative and civilian power qualities."

In other words, the EU has remained too soft on the issue of democratization in its vicinity, and this in return has caused a serious backlash for the EU in the form of the return of security threats such as terrorism which it is not ready to fight, given its emphasis on soft-power tools. During the Arab Spring revolts, then, the EU lost its relevance as a democratizing force for the Arab protestors because of its weak commitment to the wave of democratization in the Arab world. Finally, the economic crisis hit the EU severely, and dealt a severe blow in terms of its reliability and credibility for neighboring regions. In addition to the Middle East, the EU has also softened its rigid conditionality in Eastern Europe, as proven by its attempt to convince Ukraine under the Yanukovych government to sign the Association Agreement, which was dubbed as a “bulwark against Russian aggression”, while lifting sanctions on Belarus in 2016, which were imposed because of its poor democracy and human rights record."

This principle of natural limits goes back to the 17th Century, when France and Spain agreed on the border dividing them in the Treaty of Pyrenees. “In 1792, in France, the theory of natural frontiers was invoked for geopolitical ends to justify external conquests in the Hainaut region of Belgium, and, in the south-east, the County of Nice and Savoy.” (Dumont and Verluise, 2016). It survived the subsequent centuries and still applies in many border cases in Europe such as the 1947 Paris Treaty between France and Italy over the borderline on the upper valleys of Tinée and Vésubie rivers, which was drawn on the basis of drainage lines. In northern Europe, the Swedish-Norwegian border is also based on the same natural border principle as it passes through the drainage line of the Scandinavian mountains. Lastly, Poland’s southern borders with the Czech Republic and with Slovakia are other prominent cases of the implementation of natural border theory as both the Carpathians and Sudetes Mountain ranges constitute the natural borderline."

This has led to a change in the meaning of borders across the EU, and external borders have gained a new relevance and importance in the face of security concerns following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the growing tide of illegal immigrants in the 2000s. Thus, the protection of external borders has become a pressing necessity. “Within twenty years of the demolition of the Berlin Wall, Western Europe, once the main critic of the closed borders of Eastern European communist regimes, has closed its southern and eastern borders, built fences and established an EU agency, Frontex, to help border states guard its long maritime border” (Mamadouh, 2015: 58). These controversial measures, accompanied by the outsourcing and offshoring of external border protection, have been criticized for being exclusionary and otherising."

    "explanation": "During the heightened Cold War era, Europe was geopolitically divided into two bitterly hostile parts in the form of Eastern Europe (the Socialist bloc) and Western Europe (the Capitalist bloc), signifying the ideological and political enmity between the two competing blocs (Berentsen,1993). At that time, nevertheless, geopolitics was not so popular in Europe because of its past association with the fascist regimes in the 1930s, and has been labeled as a highly militarist and determinist form of Realist International Relations School in the face of the tense Cold War rivalry. In the words of one analyst (Techau, 2013), “The intellectual concept of geopolitics originated in Europe, yet it is here that it is most unpopular today. It smacks of the ugly realism that many Europeans find so difficult to embrace. And it is too disquieting a reminder that history has not ended, and that the current peaceful state of the continent may not last forever.” Indeed the European integration project launched in the 1950s was devised and regarded as an antidote to the geopolitical thinking by nature (Guzzini, 2012: 62): “…the EU has staked its reputation on being an anti-geopolitical unit. In the memorable phrase of Ole Wæver, ‘Europe’s other is Europe’s past’, the EU being a peace organization, a ‘civilian’ or ‘normative’ power, aimed precisely at overcoming the militarism and nationalism, historically associated with classical geopolitical thought, that had plagued Europe’s early twentieth century.” The restoration of peace in Europe after long centuries of conflict between European nations was the main success of the 70 year-long European integration, and due to this success, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012."

    "explanation": "Page 164.<br/>The main goal of the EU neighborhood policy, creating “a ring of friendly states”, has become “a ring of fire” in the second half of 2010s. While other states, most notably Russia, did not view Brussels as a partner but a geopolitical competitor, the Arab Spring dealt a severe blow to EU efforts to export its values and norms to the Middle East and North Africa. These unfavorable events and developments in Eastern and Southern neighborhoods “… arguably altered the Union’s strategic environment significantly” (Pänke, 2019: 111). As Europe turns inwards, and is busy with putting its own house in order in the wake of the simultaneous crises it has faced recently, it is claimed that it is seriously threatened by its eastern neighbor (Russia) and its southern and southeastern neighborhood (ISIS terrorism and irregular migration). Therefore the EU has to take “traditional aspects of geopolitics and strategic thinking” (Nitoiu and Sus, 2019: 1) into consideration in its dealings with these challenges and threats. During the second half of the 2010s, in fact, traditional geopolitics seems to have influenced the EU policymakers’ foreign policy thinking despite the denials of any geopolitical interest by the EU itself as a normative and civilian power in its external relations.

Thus “The Union establishes a hierarchical order via geopolitical modelling of different layers of influence and power” (Pänke, 2019: 107).

    "explanation": "UNASUR and the SDC sought to enhance regional security cooperation and produce public security goods as well as designing and implementing policies such as conflict mediation. Brazil’s regional security policy also reflected the principles of consensual hegemony. Rather than providing material security goods through military spending, Brazil’s regional leadership in the security realm had a robust ideational dimension. Geopolitically, Brasília aimed to reinforce a regional security identity to prevent external interference from Europe and North America (Burges, 2017: 175). On many occasions, Brazil expressed in words its support for the protection of norms such as democracy and sovereignty in the region, which constituted the main foundations of the security concept that it advocated. Brazil’s direct interventions in the Ecuadorian-Peruvian War in 1995 and the Haitian crisis in 2004 constituted exceptional cases. Brazil only intervened when it perceived that the arbitration was necessary to maintain its stature as a regional power and an important global actor (Burges, 2008: 79). As the regional integration process deepened, UNASUR appeared as the major conflict mediator and crisis manager under the leadership of Brazil, thereby replacing the role of the OAS. The South American region witnessed UNASUR’s successful efforts in managing the Bolivian crisis (2008) and mediating the dispute between Colombia and Venezuela (2010) (Nolte and Wehner, 2012: 10-11; Sanahuja, 2017). UNASUR and the SDC thus reflected autonomist strategies aimed at counterbalancing the US’s power in the Western Hemisphere. Similarly, these institutions constituted an alternative to the OAS, which was primarily driven by US preferences, and thus challenged the US’s primacy in shaping the region’s security agenda (Nolte and Wehner, 2012)."

    "explanation": "As the second-largest economy in the world, China’s engagement with the Latin American region over the last two decades has had important implications for the region and its relations with the US. China recently expanded its trade, military and investment ties with the region, fuelled by its commodity demand, in order to expand its own industrialisation (Ellis, 2016: 291). China’s trade volume with Latin America increased from 12 billion USD in 2000 to 260 billion USD in 2013. Chinese loans reached 37 billion USD in 2010 and decreased to 29 billion in 2015, whereas they had remained under 1 billion USD until 2008 (Piccone, 2016: 3). China displaced the US as the main trade partner of Brazil, Chile and Peru. The share of Latin American imports from the US out of its total imports saw a decline from 50 percent in 2000 to 33 percent in 2016. China’s share in Latin American imports increased from 3 percent to 18 percent in this period (Oppenheimer, 2017). From 2000 onward, Chinese presidents Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping made several visits to Latin American countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela. In these visits, China’s aim was to enhance cooperation with the region in various areas, such as energy, trade, infrastructure, finance, technology and the military, based on South-South Cooperation and mutual respect for national sovereignty (Ellis, 2016: 296; Piccone, 2016)."

    },
    "explanation": "From the mid-1990s onward, Brazil started to view South America as part of its sphere of influence, and also sought to enhance its role in the Caribbean region (Serbin, 2014:71; Flemes, 2009). In Central America, Brazil did not exert much power where it faced substantial competition from Mexico (Burges, 2017: 198-199). In contrast to the Latin American identity, the idea of a distinct South America was a recent creation. During the mid-1990s, Brazilian president F. H. Cardoso (1995-2002) promoted a South American regional identity with its separate geopolitical agenda. Later president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-2011) prioritised the achievement of prosperity and stability in the sub-region as a primary foreign policy goal. Brazil views Argentina as its main partner in deepening the South American integration project (Flemes, 2009: 167; Burges, 2017: 199-200). Labelled by Burges (2008; 2015), the idea of “consensual hegemony” (later “cooperative hegemony”) was the result of Brazil’s search for a new position in a changing global order: a unipolar world order after the Cold War, globalisation and US detachment from the region. In the past, Brazil had followed different strategies to insert itself into the international system, such as Third-Worldism or siding with the US. In the new scenario, Brazil’s response was to recast its identity as a sub-regional consensual hegemony by forging the construction of an autonomous, integrated South America (Burges, 2008: 74). The Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff (2011-2016) governments also focused on Africa and the Global South, expanding Cardoso’s geopolitical imagination beyond the Americas (Burges, 2017). These leaders crafted regional institutions (MERCOSUR and UNASUR) and participated actively in extra-regional alliances (BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa; IBSA - with India and South Africa; and the G20 for trade) in an effort to enhance regional autonomy, reform global governance and counterbalance the US hegemony (Serbin, 2014; Williams, 2012)."

Mackinder in his paper “The Geographical Pivot of History” (1904) and his best known work Democratic Ideals and Reality: A Study in the Politics of Reconstruction (1919). The heartland theory emerged from Mackinder’s detailed study of the global relationship between land and sea power.\n Mackinder postulated the dominating influence of certain geographic “realities” on the course of world politics. His realities included (1) “world island” (Europe, Asia and Africa) surrounding the Eurasian “heartland” or “pivot area,” which is inaccessible from the sea; (2) its coastlands, called the “inner” or “marginal crescent,” made up of maritime powers; and (3) insular power bases composed of North and South America and Australia, called the “insular” or “outer crescent”. Based on his assumptions of the growing ascendancy of land power over sea power, Mackinder warned that “who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; who rules the Heartland commands the World Island; who rules the World Island command the World. Mackinder advocated policies aimed at creating an equilibrium of power between the land and sea powers so that no single country would be in a position to dominate the pivot area.

    },
    "explanation": "Turkey has historically been a crossroad. That is, its peoples and goods have been crossing from one region to the other through not only the land but also the seaways Turkey today borders. The mobility of peoples came along with wars, invasions and conquests only to be followed by tensions, conflict and more wars. The region therefore has always been important in military terms as well. Even though the mass mobility of the people was considered to have lessened in modern times, the events of the recent years have proven this consideration wrong in the most dramatical ways. Besides, the centuries old movement of peoples has created a multi-cultural structure which brings richness to the region but at the same time bears seeds of conflict. The movement of the goods on the other hand has never stopped. On the contrary, it has increased. Today the transfer of oil and gas from their producers to consumers - both of whom are neighboring regions of Turkey - is one of the top issues on the global agenda along with energy security. It is therefore considered that Turkey’s geopolitical position brings it certain advantages along with some vulnerabilities.\n Furthermore, the defense of the region of the Straits poses many problems. In addition to being exposed to attacks by sea and air, Turkey does not posses strategic depth in its European territories."

In addition, while the elite of Turkey has defined Turkey as a Western society, the elite of the West refuses to accept Turkey as such.

    "correctAnswer": "E",
    "options": {
      "A": "Turkey has always defined itself as Arabic.",
      "B": "Turkey’s priority, even before the Republic, has been the Middle East.",

      "E": "European Union has always been more than an economic union for Turkey."
    },
    "explanation": "Turkey’s priority, even before the Republic, has been Europe and the West; to define itself as European/Western, to be a part of Europe and the West and adopting both domestic and foreign policies that serve this aim. Even though for a certain period they coincide, the West and Europe in Turkish geopolitics do not always mean the same thing. Till the post-World War II era, the terms west and Europe or westernization and Europeanization were used interchangeably. But after the Second World War “West” came to mean more than Europe and in fact surpassed Europe. It came to mean the Western Bloc but mostly its leader United States. Still Turkey filed its application for the membership of then European Economic Community. Even though European Union had started as an economic union at first, for Turkey it was always more than that. It was about ideals, principles and culture as well as progress and prosperity. It was a route that was decided and drawn and confirmed by the founding founders and their predecessors. Therefore even though Turkey would still be a part of the West through the NATO alliance, it still wanted to be a part of Europe as an idea."

    "explanation": "The Heartland Theory was developed by British geographer Sir Halford J. Mackinder in his paper “The Geographical Pivot of History” (1904) and his best known work Democratic Ideals and Reality: A Study in the Politics of Reconstruction (1919). The heartland theory emerged from Mackinder’s detailed study of the global relationship between land and sea power. Mackinder postulated the dominating influence of certain geographic “realities” on the course of world politics.\n His realities included (1) “world island” (Europe, Asia and Africa) surrounding the Eurasian “heartland” or “pivot area,” which is inaccessible from the sea; (2) its coastlands, called the “inner” or “marginal crescent,” made up of maritime powers; and (3) insular power bases composed of North and South America and Australia, called the “insular” or “outer crescent”.\n Based on his assumptions of the growing ascendancy of land power over sea power, Mackinder warned that “who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; who rules the Heartland commands the World Island; who rules the World Island command the World."
