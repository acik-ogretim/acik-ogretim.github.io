Taylor not only focused on the efficiency; by focusing on work processes to increase efficiency, he also systematically studied human behavior and the interaction of people with their tasks and physical conditions. In order to achieve his goal of maximum output, he focused on developing <em>stable and predictable work behaviors and </em><em>eliminating or reducing variability resulting from human factors.</em> Believing that the primary employee motivation was money, Taylor developed piece-rate systems of pay that is <em>differential incentive systems </em>based on extra completed work. On the other hand, <em><strong>Hawthorne studies</strong></em> led the researchers turn their attention to leadership in organizations, who believed that the productivity could be increased not only by financial rewards but with cooperative behavior of managers and supervisors with employees. Because, one of the influencing results of the Hawthorne studies suggested that employees perform better if they receive attention and recognition."

Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856-1915), who was an engineer and manufacturing manager at a steel company in U.S., is best known for defining scientific management techniques, in other words applying engineering principles to the study of work tasks. Although, many people criticize his approach for treating the employees rather like machines(According to Morgan’s (1986) “machine” organizational metaphor, people are expected to work similar to clockwork, with certain procedures and repeat them mechanically.) not humans, his lasting approach formed the basis of modern management studies.

    },
    "explanation": "After the First World War, the effect of human and psychological factors became the main focus of organizational studies, which formed the second milestone of OB history. Most of the studies followed the footsteps of Taylor, and focused on efficiency of work activities. During 1925 to 1932, a series of studies known as Hawthorne Studies, conducted at Hawthorne Plant of the Western Electric Company; the studies at first was influenced from the scientific management principles, but developed to be the major research advancement in understanding of human behavior in organizations. The research at the Hawthorne Plant, which consisted of four separate studies that last over a seven-year period was directed by Fritz Roethlisberger; but Elton Mayo was the influential researcher who encouraged the organization’s management to further develop the Hawthorne studies which were preceded by a series of studies focusing on the effect of illumination conducted by himself in Philadelphia textile industry. These studies, consisting of several experiments, were initiated to investigate the effect of characteristics of work setting (specifically the lighting or illumination level) on the productivity of employees consisting of test groups (for whom the level of illumination varied) and control groups (for whom the level of illumination held constant). Unexpected results of the experiments surprised the researchers who discovered that employee productivity increased approximately at a same rate, for both test and control groups. This particular effect which lacks the direct cause and effect relation, derived from the first experiments, became known as the Hawthorne effect. It suggests that human motivation, which was not included in the research, has an important role in work settings. The researchers found out that the surprising results they obtained were due to the effect of many factors influencing the behavior of Hawthorne employees. The employees, receiving attention of the research team, behaved differently when being studied than they might otherwise, and they were willing to cooperate with the researchers to reveal their desired results. After this first experiment, other important results were derived from the following experiments. The researchers also discovered the attitudes and feelings of employees; manager’s behavior or leadership; social and interpersonal human dynamics, and the behavioral norms set by the task group, as critically important factors for productivity.

Taylor indicated that with division of labor and work specialization, time and effort of employees for the production of a unit of product will be reduced which results in a more efficient production process. Taylor not only focused on the efficiency; by focusing on work processes to increase efficiency, he also systematically studied human behavior and the interaction of people with their tasks and physical conditions. In order to achieve his goal of maximum output, he focused on developing stable and predictable work behaviors and eliminating or reducing variability resulting from human factors.

With an emphasis on human side of organizations, human relations view attracted many research; but later important criticisms occurred due to its emphasis on mostly small and informal groups and the relations among the group members. The human relations approach ignored the formal organization and its relation with the environment. In 1960s, a major shift of thinking occurred, which was represented as a new scientific paradigm; this identified a third milestone in the OB history. The development of <strong>systems-theory in life-sciences as a multidisciplinary approach</strong> affected the way of thinking in organizations.<br/>Systems theory changed the way of thinking in organizational studies; starting from 1960s, research which were undertaken within the framework of contingency theory dominated the organizational behavior field. <strong>Contingency theory</strong>, which was first termed in 1967 by Lawrence and Lorsch who investigated the effect of uncertainty and variance on organizations; represents an important part of systems approach. Within the scope of contingency theory, organizations are studied as a system. The theory focuses on both the relations of sub-systems of the organization and the relation of these sub-systems with the situations outside the organizations. Contingency theory did not totally remove the assumptions of prior approaches, but it brought a new perspective to them, which were the consideration of environmental factors and the fit of organizational factors with these external factors.<br/>As can be understood from the nformation given, the correct answer is E.

    "explanation": "Managing organizational behavior in today’s organizations is especially challenging for organizations which face many outstanding rapid changes in their external environment. These challenges can be grouped into four; which are;<br/><ol type=\"I\"> <li>increasing globalization</li> <li>need to understand diverse workforce</li> <li>advancing technology</li> <li>managing ethical issues</li> </ol> These challenges should be addressed by organizations with increasing sensitivity for managing their human resources.<br/><strong>Challenge I. Increasing Globalization</strong><br/>Although globalization has many benefits (increase in sales due to activities in countries other than domestic country and reduction of costs, are the most outstanding ones), it also bring along some important risks in terms of OB. First, because the foreign managers might have different views about the organizational purposes and strategies, the coordination of global activities might arouse as a risk and the conflicts might occur due to inadequate communication. In order to manage the risks associated with this, the organizations rotate their managers to other countries in which they have operations; by this way, they can directly gain information about the problems and other necessary issues. These managers called as expatriate managers (also briefly called as ‘expat’), help the organizations to coordinate their activities in foreign countries with respect to organizational procedures and standards. On the other hand, global organizations should also consider the risks of terrorism; environmental disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other crises. Global organizations might become the targets for terrorist attacks due to their country of origin. The threat of terrorism has an important but negative effect on global operations. It is not only about damaging the foreign organizations’ property which is indicated as a symbol of the organization’s countryof-origin; but there is the threat of kidnapping or murdering organizations’ managers or employees. Furthermore, global organizations are also found to be responsible of environmental destruction (i.e. pollution, global warming). Besides to these, the challenge of managing an increasingly diverse workforce is related to globalization.<br/><strong>Challenge II. Need to Understand Diverse </strong><br/>Globalization created a competitive environment which organizations may respond with new products that meet the changing customer demands. Companies ensure the development of new ideas, through diversity. Diversity of workforce brings different perspectives, due to interaction of different skills, talents and experiences of employees, which is an important driver of creativity leading to innovation. New ideas and products develop as a result of multiple ideas. Being aware of this, organizations handle diversity management as an ongoing activity. On the other hand, a culturally diverse workforce helps organizations to overcome language and cultural barriers. In addition, organizations could also benefit from generational diversity, by creating mentorship and coaching programs for younger generations.<br/><strong>Challenge III. Advancing Technology</strong><br/>By increasing productivity, reducing production costs and prices, and helping to raise real wages, the process of innovation initiated by technological progress can help to transform economies and improve living standards. Recent technologies helped to increase effectiveness by product quality improvement and low-costs, and in addition, creativity and innovation also enhanced effectiveness. In accordance, advances of technology have tremendous effects on organizational behavior. First of all, the technological progress in all fields creates automation at workplace. This implies substantial transformations at workplace and changes for all employees. This means that an important portion of existing jobs would be lost and new jobs would be gained. This requires development of new skills for employees. Because new technology usage brings new skill requirements, continuous training is essential. Since technological change is so rapid, organizations should find ways for their employees to constantly make them learn and adapt these changes.<br/><strong>Challenge IV. Managing Ethical Issues</strong><br/>Ethics is important for OB because it can enhance or reduce the motivation, loyalty and well-being of employees. Concern for ethical issues increased due to major corporate scandals. Ethical norms and standards within the organization specify the actions of organizations for making profits, therefore it is necessary to document these principles as code of ethics. For fulfilling their actions ethically, organizations should establish an ethical code and create a system based on rewards and punishments for the enforcement of their ethical code. Developing ethical codes help organizations to protect their reputations. These codes are important for managers and employees to understand how to behave when faced with ethical issues. However, since the distinction between ethical and unethical behavior is not clear, ethical codes may not be comprehensive, and as a result organizations probably face ethical dilemmas.<br/>As can be understood from the information, the correct answer is E. All of the following answer choices i.e. “increasing globalization”, “need to understand diverse workforce”, “advancing technology” and “managing ethical issues” are the challenges for Organizational Behaviour in changing environment."

The transitions were mainly due to the use of steam as a power instead of human or animal power, and the invention and adoption of machines used for production instead of hand-made products. The correct answer is Choice C."

Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856-1915), who was an engineer and manufacturing manager at a steel company in U.S., is best known for defining scientific management techniques, in other words applying engineering principles to the study of work tasks. But, also with an engineering background, as he applied the scientific principles to human behavior in organizations, emphasizing human productivity and efficiency in work-behavior; Taylor’s work is generally recognized as the beginning of the history of modern organizational behavior.

    "explanation": "After the First World War, the effect of human and psychological factors became the main focus of organizational studies, which formed the second milestone of OB history. Most of the studies followed the footsteps of Taylor, and focused on efficiency of work activities. During 1925 to 1932, a series of studies known as Hawthorne Studies, conducted at Hawthorne Plant of the Western Electric Company; the studies at first was influenced from the scientific management principles, but developed to be the major research advancement in understanding of human behavior in organizations. The research at the Hawthorne Plant, which consisted of four separate studies that last over a seven-year period was directed by Fritz Roethlisberger; but Elton Mayo was the influential researcher who encouraged the organization’s management to further develop the Hawthorne studies which were preceded by a series of studies focusing on the effect of illumination conducted by himself in Philadelphia textile industry.

      "E": "There mainly exist four stages."
    },
    "explanation": "With an emphasis on human side of organizations, human relations view attracted many research; but later important criticisms occurred due to its emphasis on mostly small and informal groups and the relations among the group members. The human relations approach ignored the formal organization and its relation with the environment. In 1960s, a major shift of thinking occurred, which was represented as a new scientific paradigm; this identified a third milestone in the OB history. The development of systems-theory in life-sciences as a multidisciplinary approach affected the way of thinking in organizations. There exist mainly three stages, defined as input, transformation and output, which each of the stage are affected from each other and by the forces outside the organization. The input stage consists of acquisition of raw materials, machinery and equipment, financial resources and human resources as well. At this stage, recruitment of skilled employees, training them both for work procedures and obtaining the other necessary resources at a reasonable cost and time are the key issues to be considered. After the organization obtain the necessary resources, next at the transformation stage, the inputs are converted to outputs that are finished ready-to-sell products, by using human skills and machinery and equipment. In order to produce the products (either goods or services) which satisfy the customers’ needs, the managers should create the necessary procedures and motivate the employees to behave accordingly to complete their tasks. It is also necessary to develop the skills of the employees, due to the occurrence of changes, such as new technologies, changing customer demands, or regulations. The organization offers its products in its external environment to the customers, as outputs, at the output stage. The correct answer is Choice C."

Within the scope of contingency theory, organizations are studied as a system. The theory focuses on both the relations of sub-systems of the organization and the relation of these sub-systems with the situations outside the organizations.

    },
    "explanation": "This theory goes back to Carl Jung in the 1920s. Jung thought that people could be typed into extraverts and introverts and that they had two basic mental processes-perception and judgment. Then, he divided perception into sensing and intuiting and judgment into thinking and feeling. This created four personality dimensions or traits: (1) introversion/extraversion, (2) perceiving/judging, (3) sensing/ intuition, and (4) thinking/feeling. He felt that although people had all four of these dimensions in common, they differ in the combination of their preferences of each. Importantly, he made the point that one’s preferences were not necessarily better than another’s, only different. About 20 years after Jung developed his theoretical types, in the 1940s Katharine Briggs and Isabel Briggs-Myers developed about a 100-item personality test asking participants how they usually feel or act in particular situations in order to measure the preferences on the four pairs of traits yielding 16 distinct types. Called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or simply MBTI, the questions relate to how people prefer to focus their energies (extraversion vs. introversion); give attention and collect information (sensing vs. intuiting); process and evaluate information and make decisions (thinking vs. feeling); and orient themselves to the outside world (judging vs. perceiving). The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is the most widely used personality assessment instrument in the world. It is a 100-question personality test that asks people how they usually feel or act in particular situations. Respondents are classi_ed as extraverted or introverted (E or I), sensing or intuitive (S or N), Thinking or feeling (T or F), and judging or perceiving (J or P). The correct answer is Choice D."

Machiavellianism is a personality trait that is characterized by manipulative and exploitative attitude toward others, lack of empathy, and a cynical view of human nature (Inancsi, Lang and Bereczkei, 2016). Machiavellians are characterized by agency and progress rather than connectedness to others and the community. Thus, they are usually autonomous, self-seeking, and lack social connectedness with others. These people are described as being coldhearted, self-seeking, dominant and lacking emphaty (Jones and Paulhus, 2011; Inancsi et al., 2016). Machiavellianism may be delineated by a combination of attributes such as dominant, self-seeking-utilitarian, secretive, suspicious, norm-avoiding, thinking in concrete and pragmatic terms as well as emotionally unstable and anxious in the context of close relationships (Inancsi, Lang and Bereczkei, 2015). The correct answer is Choice C."

      "C": "Registration",
      "D": "Interpretation",

    },
    "explanation": "The first important sub-process is the stimulus or situation that is present. Perception begins when a person is confronted with a stimulus or a situation. This confrontation may be with the immediate sensual stimulation or with the total physical and sociocultural environment. In addition to the situation-person interaction, there are the internal cognitive processes of registration, interpretation, and feedback. During the registration phenomenon, the physiological (sensory and neural) mechanisms are affected; the physiological ability to hear and see will affect perception. Interpretation is the most significant cognitive aspect of perception. It means that a person recognizes and evaluates the target or the situation. The other psychological processes will affect the interpretation of a situation. For example, in an organization, employees’ interpretations of a situation are largely dependent on their learning and motivation and their personality. The last sub-process is the feedback. Feedback is the response that a person received from the perceptual target or the situation. Later, follow the behavior and consequences. The correct answer is Choice C."

    },
    "explanation": "Perceptual errors are the mistakes in the perceptual process. Stereotype and the halo effect are the common perceptual errors. Stereotypes are the beliefs and perceived attributes about a target based on any characteristic. The term stereotype refers to the tendency to perceive another person (hence social perception) as belonging to a single class or category. In particular, it is employed in analyzing prejudice. Not commonly acknowledged is the fact that stereotyping may attribute favorable or unfavorable traits to the person being perceived. Most often a person is put into a stereotype because the perceiver knows only the overall category to which the person belongs. However, because each individual is unique, the real traits of the person will generally be quite different from those the stereotype would suggest.<br/>Stereotyping greatly influences social perception in today’s organizations. Common stereotyped groups include managers, supervisors, knowledge workers, union members, young people, old people, minorities, women, people with disabilities, white- and blue-collar workers, and all the various functional and staff specialists, for example, accountants, salespeople, computer programmers, and engineers (Luthans, 2010).<br/>The halo effect in social perception is very similar to stereotyping. Whereas in stereotyping the person is perceived according to a single category, under the halo effect the person is perceived on the basis of one trait. Halo is often discussed in performance appraisal when a rater makes an error in judging a person’s total personality and/or performance on the basis of a single positive trait such as intelligence, appearance, dependability, or cooperativeness. Whatever the single trait is, it may override all other traits in forming the perception of the person. For example, a person’s physical appearance or dress may override all other characteristics in making a selection decision or in appraising the person’s performance.<br/>The opposite is sometimes called the “horns effect” where an individual is downgraded because of a single negative characteristic or incident. The correct answer is Choice E."

    },
    "explanation": "Internally caused behaviors are those we believe to be under the personal control of the individual. Externally caused behavior is what we imagine the situation forced the individual to do. Distinctiveness refers to whether an individual displays different behaviors in different situations. If everyone who faces a similar situation responds in the same way, we can say the behavior shows consensus. An observer looks for consistency in a person’s actions. Does the person respond the same way over time? Coming in 10 minutes late for work is not perceived in the same way for an employee who hasn’t been late for several months as it is for an employee who is late two or three times a week. The more consistent the behavior, the more we are inclined to attribute it to internal causes. Individuals and organizations also tend to attribute their own successes to internal factors such as ability or effort, while blaming failure on external factors such as bad luck or unproductive co-workers. People also tend to attribute their success to internal factors, but tend to attribute their failures to the external factors. This is called as the self-serving bias.

One set, called terminal values, refers to desirable end-states. These are the goals a person would like to achieve during his or her lifetime. The other set, called instrumental values, refers to preferable modes of behavior, or means of achieving the terminal values. Some examples of terminal values in the Rokeach Value Survey are: Prosperity and economic success, Freedom, Health and well-being, World peace, Social recognition, and Meaning in life.

Individuals who satisfy these needs feel themselves as exerting their full capacity. Of course the level of satisfaction depends on the person’s perspective. One can be actualized by “being an ideal mother”, the other by “painting pictures” or “teaching adults”. As Maslow stated the first four needs are counted as deficiency needs which activated when unfulfilled, the last level of need self-actualization is known as growth need because it endures even when satisfied.

Examples of these needs are shelter, certain situations etc. For work setting secure job and insurance can be cited.<br/>If physiological and safety needs are gratified enough, the third level of need is emerged. <em>Love needs </em>are the needs related to affection and belongingness. Looking for friendship or a partner, building affectionate relationships, being loved or connected are the kinds of these needs.

His model was widely accepted since empirical studies started. These studies resulted that people do not go through the hierarchy in the same order as Maslow asserted.

Although his theory has empirical concerns he contributed the literature by offering a holistic and humanistic perspective. He was pioneered as the founder of positive psychology.

They were motivated only by money or other material gains. On the other hand, Theory Y assumes that employees can enjoy working and see it as natural as fun. They like to take responsibility and try to do their best. Employees can be motivated by more humanistic initiatives like recognition and development.

      "D": "Equity Theory",
      "E": "Expectancy Theory"
    },
    "explanation": "Self-Efficacy Theory (also known as social cognitive theory or social learning theory) refers to the belief of an individual about being capable of performing a task. Bandura (1995) explains that it “refers to beliefs in one’s capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations” Self-Determination Theory was first developed as “cognitive evaluation theory (CET)” which emphasizes the strength of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors on work motivation. Basic assumption of the theory is extrinsic rewards can diminish the magnitude of intrinsic motivation.<br/>Goal-Setting Theory is developped by Locke and Latham, based on their research. Their research is built upon Ryan’s (1970) premise that <em>‘conscious goals predict action’</em>. A goal is defined as <em>‘object or aim of an action’ </em>(Locke and Latham, 2002, p.705). They proposed that motivation is related with the intention of the individual to work towards the goal.<br/>Adams (1963) developed Equity theory based on perceived inequity that individuals experience. According to him, any exchange between two people includes comparison and possible feeling of inequity at least for one party.<br/>Expectancy theory was firstly conceptualized by Vroom (1964) and then added new terms by Lawler and Porter (1983). The model of theory is based on two variables; expectancy and outcome. Individuals are motivated by the value of the outcome which is called as valence. Valence implies how important the outcome for the person and is it worth reaching it or not? The more a person is likely to reach the outcome, the more effort he/she exerts. The correct answer is Choice B."

      "E": "Feedback"
    },
    "explanation": "Hackman and Oldham (1976) developed the job characteristics model (JCM) that includes five core job dimensions in designing jobs.<br/><ol> <li><strong>Skill variety </strong>is the degree to which a job requires activities including different skills and talents. A professor scores high on this dimension because he/she designs, lectures and schedules exams, does academic work and be thesis advisory. A worker doing hand printing 8 hours in a day scores low in this dimension.</li> <li><strong>Task identity </strong>is the degree to which a job requires completion of a whole work. When a shoe retailer designs the shoe, finds the proper raw material, produces and sells it has high score on this dimension, but if another shoe retailer sells the shoes which are bought by the producer has low score on this dimension.</li> </ol> <ol start=\"3\"> <li><strong>Task significance </strong>is the extent to which the job has affects the lives or work of other people. A policeman has high task significance (society) because he/she works for the sake of the society; a human resource professional again has high task significance (work) when he/she makes decisions for the well-being of the employees.</li> <li><strong>Autonomy </strong>is the degree to which a job provides employee initiative in deciding about work related activities. One example for highly autonomous job can be given below: A product manager schedules her meetings, decides the most effective marketing tool for the product and arranges her management style in accordance with her employees. When a product manager is given a direction to do her job, he/she has low autonomous job.</li> <li><strong>Feedback </strong>is the degree to which a job provides direct and objective information about the progress and performance delivered by the supervisor or the job itself. A machine operator receiving direct information about the process receives high feedback. If another machine operator routes his work to other workers, he/she receives low and indirect feedback. The correct answer is Choice C.</li> </ol>"

Even though they look like a group, if there is no interaction between them, people who are physically together can’t be called a group. For this reason, the correct answer is E."

And also, they don’t consider themselves a part of any identifiable unit. <em><strong>Swarm</strong></em> is characterized by a flurry of collective activity involving anyone who is able to add value to a task. They form quickly, solve the problem or grab an opportunity, and then quickly disperse. Their members are not members of the same formal group, and probably include people who have never worked together. However, academic researchers refer to this work arrangement as a huddle. <em><strong>Huddle</strong></em> is a short term, a focused interaction occurring between two or more individuals in an organization which discusses work issues and which enhances learning. They are low on formality and high on task content; include problem-solving and information sharing activities. Huddles are usually considered to be more of an event than a type of group."

Country club managers focus on building positive relations among employees even when production is low.<br/>• Task management; this leader has a high concern for production, on the other hand minimum concern for people. They apply restrict control on working and perceive employees as a part of machines for achieving goals. So they don’t care much about employees’ problems or needs.<br/>• Middle of the road management; this leader has a moderate concern for production and people. So there is a moderate effort to accomplish the tasks by creating a good working environment. Middle of the road managers try to keep the status quo by adopting moderate approach.<br/>• Impoverished management; this leader has neither a concern for people nor concern for production. Managers show little effort on building relationships with employees or getting the tasks completed.<br/>• Team management; in this leadership style, both job satisfaction and productivity are high, because the leader has a high concern for both people and production. There is a peaceful working environment and strong relationship between the leaders and the employees, but the focus still remains on achieving the organizational goals."

    "explanation": "Relationship conflict (socioemotional conflict) is the conflict that arouses among people with personal dissonance or tension. This type of conflict is about relationships or emotional aspects, no deal with organizational issues. For example, if one employee complains about high volume of speech of his/her co-worker, or in one department one team makes gossip about the other team, then relationship conflict exists in these two work context. Therefore, negative emotions like resentment, annoyance, and sadness are felt by conflict partners, and group performance can decrease. On the other side, task conflict is about task related issues. It is peculiar to disagreement about task content or about work goals (Jehn, 1997, p.88-89). For example, two human resource specialists are in conflict about the candidates which one more proper for the position of sales representative. One of the HR specialist thinks that the woman at the ages of 30s has deep experience in marketing, and can be more successful as a sales representative. The other HR specialist thinks that the man at at the ages of 40s can speak three languages and is talkative in interviews, so he can be the proper candidate for that position. This type of conflict can be beneficial for organization; especially in non-routine, complex jobs like strategy formation or product development. Different ideas or viewpoints can be channelled into brainstorming which supports decision participation and high quality decision-making. If task conflict is managed properly, it can enhance team performance and team member satisfaction. The third conflict type is process conflict. It refers to a disagreement pertaining to how the task will be done, who will be in charge of completing the task. This kind of conflict is associated with lower morale or group performance (Jehn, 1999). The correct answer is Choice C."

      "E": "Felt conflict consists of cognitive awareness of disagreement that results when relational incompatibilities or injustices are recognized."
    },
    "explanation": "Latent Conflict: The first stage called as “latent conflict” means potential sources of conflict such as different values, needs, resource scarcity or goal incompatibility exist. Although the sources are rooted in organization for a long time of period, the partners does not perceive the tension. This stage is called latent until the partners intent to change the situation. In other words, if the partners are not aware of the tension, or do not act to change the situation, the conflict will not emerge. Perceived Conflict: The second stage refers to partners’ becoming fully aware that they are in conflict. This is the stage when one party perceives the other to be likely to thwart or frustrate his/her goals. Felt Conflict: The third stage points emotional involvement in conflict. The partners are not only aware of the conflict, but also feel negative emotions like tension, and anxiety. Felt emotions help individuals to perceive that they are in conflict (Bodtker and Jameson, 2001). Jehn (1997) proposed that negative emotions felt during conflict in groups hamper the resolution of conflict. Perceived conflict consists of cognitive awareness of disagreement that results when relational incompatibilities or injustices are recognized, whereas felt conflict represents affective recognition of these concerns and resultant anger, tension, or frustration. Manifest Conflict: The fourth stage is the stage where the conflict becomes visible. Partners show a clear conflictful behavior, such as open aggression. Which behavior accepted as conflictful depends on the culture of organization and the perception of the conflict partners. If the behavior is against the norms of the culture and people perceive it to be conflicftul, then manifest conflict can be called for the reactions or statements of the partners. The second criteria to call the behavior as conflictful, partners consciously prefer to behave like that. The correct answer is Choice D."

Weber was criticized because of designing an iron cage for the employees, which decreases creativity, increases dissatisfaction and demotivation. Employees treated as mindless, ignorant and desperate individuals who strongly need guidance, direction and command in typical bureaucratic systems. Rules, instructions and guidelines are generally superficially designed and they do not include all exceptional circumstances of work in typical bureaucracy.

On the contrary, more managers have direct control over lesser numbers of employees in organizations that have narrow spans control. Therefore, it is possible to expect a tall hierarchy in organizations when spans of control are narrow and a shorter one when spans of control are wide. A preference of wide or narrow span of control may depend on several factors such as knowledge, ability and skill levels of the employees, degree of standardization of work activities, ability of managers to control his or her subordinates. Span of controls in organizations is not the only factor directly affecting hierarchy of authority.

There is a positive relation between the number of units/departments and horizontal complexity. It is possible to expect emergence of departments after organizations reach a certain size. But, horizontal complexity is not necessarily linked with organizational size; smaller organizations may have more units than the larger ones or large organizations can survive with a simple structure. There might be various factors determining level of horizontal complexity. Organizational purpose, environmental complexity and design approach of top management team are some of these factors. An ideal organizational structure should enable information flow among hierarchical layers and units to achieve collaboration and control. Vertical design aims at increasing control over employees and work processes in organizations. Horizontal design approach gives priority to increase collaboration and information sharing among organizational units. The correct answer is Choice B."

Most state organizations such as army, ministries, educational institutions, governmental agencies and hospitals have highly formalized systems. On the other hand, private firms in knowledge intensive sectors may adopt a less formal system to increase creativity of their employees. In addition to the sectorial requirements, organizational design approach based on several contingencies may also determine level of formalization. Age and size are the other factors that lead to the emergence of formal systems in organizations. According to organizational life cycle model (Grenier, 1972; Adizes, 1979; Churchill and Levis, 1983; Lester, Parnell and Carraher, 2003), it is not required to have any kind of formal systems at the entrepreneurial stage of an organization because entrepreneur-managers can easily control work processes of few employees. When organizations get larger after the start-up stage, entrepreneurs must delegate their authorities to the managers. Control capacity of managers might be insufficient after organizations reach a certain size, and which in turn, establishment of formal systems will become inevitable (Hannan and Freeman, 1984). High level of formalization caused by increasing age and size can limit adaptation capacity of an organization and may become a source of resistance against change. The correct answer is Choice A."

    "explanation": "Hierarchy of authority refers to the number of managerial levels in an organization, and it is closely related to span of control - the number of employees reporting to a supervisor (Daft, 2007). Vertical complexity is a similar term to denote number of hierarchical layers. The term “span of control” becomes meaningful when managers of two organizations compared in terms of number of employees reporting to managers. Wide spans of control in an organization simply mean that there are few managers having responsibility of many employees. On the contrary, more managers have direct control over lesser numbers of employees in organizations that have narrow spans control. Therefore, it is possible to expect a tall hierarchy in organizations when spans of control are narrow and a shorter one when spans of control are wide. A preference of wide or narrow span of control may depend on several factors such as knowledge, ability and skill levels of the employees, degree of<br/>standardization of work activities, ability of managers to control his or her subordinates. Span of controls in organizations is not the only factor directly affecting hierarchy of authority. Design perspectives of owners or managers can also determine the question of how hierarchic an organization should be. The correct answer is Choice C."
