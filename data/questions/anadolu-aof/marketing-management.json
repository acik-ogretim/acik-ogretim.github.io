Since not all consumers are similar in terms of preferences, buying habits etc., marketers define their consumers’ characteristics through market segmentation based on demographic, psychographic, behavioristic and geographic criteria.\n Business Markets: Business markets function differently than consumer markets. Their buying processes are particularly different. These markets consist of organizations that buy products or services for use in their own businesses or to make other products. For example, a dishwasher manufacturer might purchase steel, wiring, relevant equipment and so forth, as part of its final product from other parties in the business markets.\n Global Markets: Companies realizing that they saturated in their local market have started to look for new opportunities in other regions of the world. Toyota Motors, McDonald’s, Adidas, or Nestle can be given as examples having global presence for many years. In global markets, companies focus on the selection and exploration of global marketing opportunities and utilize resources around the world for achieving competitive advantage. Toyota Motors started its business as a domestic marketer and then exported its cars to regional markets, then shifted to multinational markets and now company is a true global marketer building factories in foreign countries, employing local labor and complying to that country’s cultural environment. The companies in global markets face different requirements for buying and disposing of property, such as cultural, political differences as well as currency fluctuations.\n Nonprofit and Governmental Markets: Nonprofit institutions are present for providing benefit to society and they are subject to different set of laws. Some educational institutions, charitable organizations and government agencies can be given as examples. For instance, Kızılay, Unicef or WWF offers different benefits to society. Kızılay provides aid for needy and defenseless people in disasters, Unicef specializes in promoting the practice of children’s rights. On the other hand, in governmental markets, the promised offering is reciprocated by tax offerings and other resources. Not only citizens, but also the stakeholders are influenced directly or indirectly by government legislation laws that are enacted."

All steps in the answer choices are among the main steps listed by Kotler and Armstron for marketers to follow their marketing processes.\n Understanding the market place and customer needs and want is the very first step of a marketing process. Firms firstly need to examine the main characteristics of the market(s) they serve and determine the basic needs and want of the customers.\n The starting point for establishing a customerdriven marketing strategy is understanding the main customer groups (segments) and selecting target group(s) from these segments. Since the companies cannot serve all customers in every market, such efforts in segmenting the customers and choosing the target market(s) facilitate the development of customer-driven strategy.\n Preparation of a marketing program that aims to deliver superior value to the customers requires hardwork. Such hardwork mainly includes the preparation of company’s marketing mix which consists of product/service decisions, promotion activities, place decisions, and activities.\n Customer relationship management can be considered as the initial step in building profitable relationships with the customers. In today’s competitive marketing environment, where long-term relationships are important for achieving success, more is needed in order to satisfy customers over a long period of time.\n Capturing value from customers to create profits and customer equity is the final step of a marketing process. This final step is about capturing value in return in the form of current and future sales, market share and profits."

Suppliers can have a significant influence on a manufacturer’s performance, through their contributions to cost reduction, new product design and enabling the constant improvement of quality. In today’s increasingly competitive environment, it is no longer enough to understand customers in the marketing system of the companies. Firms must pay close attention to their competitors and need to constantly compare their products, prices, channels, and promotional efforts with their competitors. The main role of marketing intermediaries is to make goods available and accessible to target markets by offering more effectiveness and efficiency than the selling company could achieve on its own. This is realized through their contacts, experience, specialization, and scale of operation.All the parties in the marketing system are affected by major environmental forces such as economic, political/ legal, demographic, physical, technological, and social/cultural forces."

    "explanation": "In the maturity stage, the product achieves as much as it is going to. This is probably the most competitive time for most products and businesses need to invest wisely in any marketing efforts they undertake.

The product has achieved acceptance by most potential buyers, so during this period there is a slowdown in sales growth. The correct answer is A."

As the level of development of countries increases, the importance given to price decreases. Non-price factors such as consumer tastes or preferences are more important in developed countries.\n<br/>Price differs from other marketing mix elements due to some reasons. Firstly, it produces revenue while others create a cost. Companies bear the costs of other marketing mix elements to create value for consumers while price captures value from them. Secondly, price is the most flexible element of the marketing mix. In other words, a change in price is reflected on demand immediately. Therefore, it is a strategic tool used by companies. However, companies should be careful while using price as a strategic tool because of its psychological effects on consumers. Lastly, price has a negative relationship with demand. This means that if the price of a product increases, the demand of it decreases and vice versa. Besides these differences, price should be consistent with other marketing mix elements.

Emotional ads mainly consist of non-verbal elements such as images and emotional stimuli. Emotional appeals focus on fear, love, humor, sex, music, fantasy, surrealism, safety and social states like gaining status or rejection. It is generally accepted that consumer’s emotions are important in decision-making and advertisers try to persuade people by affecting their feelings.\n<br/>Advertisers using rational appeals in their messages focus on the consumer’s practical, functional or utilitarian need for the product/service. They may explain the features and benefits of the product and some facts about the products, such as giving information about the warranty of a product and explaining how many years it can be used. Showing how many dishes may be washed by a detergent and emphasizing the low price is another example of the rational appeal. Here the message is given in an informative and verifiable way by the use of facts, data etc. to persuade the buyer. Common rational appeals include comfort, convenience, economy, health, touch, taste, smell, quality, dependability, durability, efficiency, efficacy and performance."

It means that you failed to create value for customers; therefore you lose customers as well as their money. Apart from money, you lose time, and effort. You also failed to develop competitive advantage and lose your competitive position in the market. As a result, you cannot help the company to achieve its corporate objectives and goals, which may in turn affect the survival of the company. This highlights the interdependence of diverse strategy levels. As stated before, successful marketing planning creates success at functional level which directly affects success at business level (e.g. competitive advantage), and accordingly success at business level brings success at corporate level (e.g. growth)."
