    "explanation": "As it comes to the classification of the written laws, the famous legal philosopher Kelsen should be remembered since he was the first jurist who made a classification showing the hierarchy of the written laws as well. The most influential legal theory of the 20th century in the Continental Europe is considered to be Kelsen’s “pure theory of law”. According to this theory, the typical legal system is founded upon a system of norms. The written laws form a part of a hierarchical system of norms, with each layer gaining authority from the previous. All the norms could be traced back through a chain of validity which is shown by a pyramid known as the Kelsen’s pyramid. At the top of this pyramid is the “Grundnorm,” namely the “Constitution” in our system. Then, the codes and statutes follow the constitution. International treaties, presidential decrees and by-laws are the other written sources in the Turkish legal system."

When the written laws are silent, a judge trying to solve a case shall try to find a customary law rule; but if the customary law is also silent, this means that there is a legal gap. At this point, the judge has to decide whether this is a real legal gap or not. If it is a real legal gap, this means that there is a need for a regulation which is not provided by the law-maker. Therefore, the judge has to lay down a legal rule himself/herself and decide the case accordingly. If it is not a real legal gap, the judge has to dismiss the case."

    "explanation": "Accordingly, in the light of the definition of the law, the essential elements of a commercial enterprise can be listed as follows:\n i. to generate an income that will be above the craftsman’s turnover to be announced: There should be a will/purpose of the enterprise to generate an income which shall be above a certain threshold to be announced by the Pesident. The criterion here is that the threshold would be above the level of the turnover of a craftsman’s enterprise. The threshold for a craftsman’s enterprise is announced by a presidential decree (Art.11/2).\n ii. continuity: The commercial business should be continuous, not temporary.\n iii. independence: This criterion qualifies a commercial enterprise from a “branch” which is not an independent unit. A branch or a commercial representative do not qualify as a commercial enterprise due to the lack of this criterion. Therefore, the criterion for independence is significant for defining a business unit as a commercial enterprise. Accordingly, a commercial enterprise has a legal capacity that is much broader than a branch which has a limited scope of activities.\n The correct answer is C."

In a democratic system, this power is the legislature, not the executive or the judiciary.

    "explanation": "Real persons who are the recipients of income are liable for income tax. Nationality does not, in principle, make any difference for income tax liability. Hence foreigners as well as Turkish national shall be subjected to income tax when they receive income.\n In general, residency criterion is applied in determining tax liability for individuals. This criterion requires that an individual whose domicile is in Turkey is liable to pay tax for his worldwide income (unlimited liability). Any person who resides in Turkey more than six months in one calendar year is assumed as a resident of Turkey. However, foreigners who stay in Turkey for six months or more by the reason of a specific job or business or particular purposes, which are specified in the PIT Law, are not treated as resident. Therefore, unlimited tax liability is not applicable for them.\n In addition to residency criterion, within a limited scope, nationality criterion also applies regardless of their residency status. Turkish citizens who live abroad and work for government or a governmental institution or a company, and whose headquarter is in Turkey, are considered as unlimited liable taxpayers. Accordingly, they are subject to PIT on their worldwide income. Non-residents are only liable to pay tax on their income derived from the incomes in Turkey (limited liability)."

      "E": "Taxes are the voluntary proportional contributions from persons"
    },
    "explanation": "As compulsory, unrequited payments to government taxes are the enforced proportional contributions from persons and property levied by the law-making body of the State by virtue of its sovereignty for the support of the government and all public needs. In modern economies taxes are the most important source of governmental revenue. Taxes differ from other sources of revenue in that they are compulsory levies and are unrequited i.e., they are generally not paid in exchange for some specific things, such as a particular public service, the sale of public property, or the issuance of public debt. While taxes are presumably collected for the welfare of taxpayers as a whole, the individual taxpayer’s liability is independent of any specific benefit received."

    },
    "explanation": "In many jurisdictions, mediation is a <strong>voluntary</strong> process. Therefore, the parties <strong>may not refer to or be forced to</strong> <strong>refer to mediation unless both of the parties wish so</strong>. The parties may mutually decide upon referring to mediation after a dispute has arisen between them, <strong>even while the court proceedings are pending</strong>; or they may enact a mediation agreement for a potential dispute that might arise, in the future, in connection with an existing legal relation between them. In practice, usually a prior mediation agreement exists as a part of a main contract between the parties, in order to enable those parties to resort to mediation in case of a dispute that might arise out of that contract. However, despite a prior written mediation agreement, the parties may always refer to courts. There is no legal consequence of referring to the court before trying mediation despite the existence of a mediation agreement. In other words, <strong>a prior mediation agreement is not binding</strong> upon the parties; there is no legal way to force an unwilling party to refer to or continue mediation. <strong>It is not possible for the parties to refer to mediation for all kinds of disputes</strong>. According to Article 1/2 of the Mediation Law, only private law disputes arising out of matters that the parties may freely dispose of, including those that carry a foreign element, can be subject to mediation. Therefore, the disputes arising out of subject matters related with public policy can not be referred to mediation. For example, spouses may not refer to mediation for divorce; or disputes concerning affiliation of a child to one of his/her parents may not be subject to mediation.
