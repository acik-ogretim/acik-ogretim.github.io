    "explanation": "By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, when the modern international law started getting its form and content, the natural law had made heavy inroads and assumed strong ideological moorings. This can be clearly seen in the writings of Francisco de Vittoria (1480-1546), Francisco Suarez (1548-1617) and Alberico Gentilis (1552-1608). International law was binding on the States because it was part of the law of nature. However, it was Hugo Grotius (1583-1645) who secularized the concept of natural law while making a distinction between jus naturale and jus gentium. He based the law of nations on customs and treaties in addition to the law of nature. The law of nature, according to him, was the dictate of right and reason, not of divine prescriptions."

Along with it came the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1921 that was later replaced by the present International Court of Justice in 1946. \n In November 1947, acting under Article 13/1 of the UN Charter, the General Assembly established the International Law Commission for the “promotion of the progressive development of international law and its codification.” Progressive development is the “preparation of draft conventions on subjects which have not yet been regulated by international law or in regard to which the law has not yet been sufficiently developed in the practice of States.”"

The concept of ‘sources of international law’ faces many conceptual difficulties. Jurists of international law do not agree on the very concept of “source.” They evaluate it from their doctrinal philosophy regarding the basis of international legal obligations.

Whereas the law-making treaties are a source of law, the treaty contracts merely purport to lay down special obligations between the parties and are not directly a source of law.\n A treaty is an express manifestation of the parties’ intention to be bound by a particular rule, and it <strong>can modify or reject the existing customary rules.

In the Barcelona Traction Light and Power Company case (Belgium v. Spain, 1970), the Court had to decide whether Belgium could exercise its right of diplomatic protection against Spain in respect of its nationals, who were shareholders in the company that was registered in Canada and operated in Spain. Spain had declared the company bankrupt and took certain other measures injurious to the company. The Court, applying the municipal law doctrine of “corporate personality”, held that the alleged wrongful acts were committed against the company and, though shareholders suffered indirectly, Belgium had no cause of action. The corporate personality is distinct from shareholders under municipal law, and separation of property rights was an important manifestation of this corporate personality. The court observed that “whenever legal issues arise concerning the right of States with regard to the treatment of companies and shareholders, as to which international law has not established its own rules, it has to refer to the relevant rules of municipal law” disregarding of which invite serious legal difficulties."

    "explanation": "McNair defines treaty as “a written agreement by which two or more states or international organizations create or intend to create a relation between themselves, operating within the sphere of international law” (McNair,1961). According to Oppenheim, international treaties are agreements, of a contractual character, between states or organizations of states, creating legal rights and obligations between the parties (Oppenheim, vol. I, 1992). The Vienna Convention defines treaty as “an international agreement concluded between states in written form and governed by international law” (Art. 2(1)/a)."

    "explanation": "The Vienna Convention is limited to written treaties in the interest of clarity and simplicity,without denying the legal validity of oral agreements. An agreement, to be termed as a treaty, should be governed by international law and not by national law. Like terminology, international law does not prescribe any form or procedure for the making of a treaty, though the constitutional law of certain states prescribes both. Only the entities enjoying international legal personality can be parties to a treaty. Article 6 of the Vienna Convention provides that “every state possesses capacity to conclude treaties.”"

It stems from the idea already known in Roman law that certain legal rules cannot be contracted out. Jus cogens is opposed to jus dispositivum, i.e., rules that yield to the will of the parties.

The use of coercion against the representative of a state for the purposes of procuring the conclusion of a treaty would be a serious matter that is sufficient to declare the treaty devoid of any legal consequence.

The rationale behind the rule may be summarized as follows:\n <ul> <li>To respect the sovereignty of States. The state must be given the first opportunity to exercise jurisdiction on those matters occurring within its own territory;</li> <li>To allow the concerned state the opportunity to afford redress within its own legal system for the alleged wrong;</li> <li>To reduce the number of possible international claims;</li> <li>To better evaluate the facts.

According to the supporters of<br/>‘objective responsibility’ doctrine, there should be<br/>a casual connection between the act and the breach<br/>by the state or by its organs.\n The State is responsible for the acts of its officials<br/>or organs, which may devolve upon it despite the<br/>absence of any fault on its part.\n Accordingly, there is no clear rule that<br/>responsibility is always based on fault or that<br/>responsibility is independent of fault. Hence<br/>there is no clear presumption either way.\n If the act is carried out<br/>deliberately, consideration of fault has insignificant<br/>role. Therefore, much depends on the context and<br/>on the interpretation of the obligation breached.<br/>The international law on state responsibility, as<br/>stated in the Draft Articles (2-12), does not consider<br/>fault as a prerequisite for an act or omission to be<br/>characterized as an international wrong.

The Tokyo Tribunal found all the defendants, except two, guilty of conspiracy to wage a war of aggression. It also awarded death penalty and imprisonment. The legality and propriety of these trials and the judgments were widely criticized on the following grounds:\n • The trials were in violation of the principle of nullum poena sine lege (no punishment without law). There were no rules of international law declaring such acts as illegal prior to the Second World War, they were not defined or made punishable and were also considered the acts of state. <br/>• Trials were an imposition of ex post facto law, giving retrospective operation to a crime that was not punishable at the time of its commission. <br/>• The tribunals were constituted by the victorious powers, whose impartiality in delivering the judgments was doubtful. <br/>• Consisting mainly of judges from the victorious States was in violation of the principle of nemo judex in causa sua (no one can be a judge in his own case). <br/>• The plea of superior orders has great relevance in the discipline of the armed forces, and it was rejected by the Tribunals without any concrete reason. <br/>• One of the arguments of the defendants was that war is waged by states and not by individuals, who are not the subjects of international law. The Nuremberg Tribunal rejected it and pointed out that “international law imposes duties and liabilities upon individuals as well as upon States.\n Therefore, the correct option is D."
