Many of the managers did not have an operations background and therefore they did not fully appreciate the importance of the operations function. After 1980s Japanese companies began offering low-cost and high-quality products, U.S. companies started to lose market share to their Japanese competitors. In order to survive, many U.S. companies started to copy Japanese approaches. But the copying process often proved unsuccessful, because it really took time to understand the Japanese approaches. It became clear that the success of Japanese companies is based on their operations strategy; which means that all their resources were designed to support the company’s business plan.

If the capacity level is equal to or greater than the demand, it prevents loss of income.<br/>• Making a production decision on stock to meet high demand will adversely affect working capital. This decision will ensure that the demand is met but there will be no income inflow until the products are sold.<br/>• A capacity plan that meets fluctuations in demand through the use of temporary personnel may adversely affect product or service quality. Employing inexperienced personnel increases error rates.<br/>• Quick response to customer demands can be made by overproduction. Many<br/>customers want to get ready for the product instead of waiting for the product.<br/>• Dependability of supply is also affected by the close proximity of capacity and demand levels. This proximity makes it difficult to remedy disruptions in product or service deliveries.<br/>• Flexibility, in particular volume flexibility, is closely related to excess capacity.

Both RFID technology and barcode technology involve the<br/>scanning of products in order to enter them into the system. The main difference between the two is that barcode systems use barcodes printed on pieces of paper, which are then stuck on the products, while RFID uses small microchips that are either placed on a tag attached to the product or on the packaging of the product itself.<br/>Another major difference is the bandwidth of the two technologies. A barcode scanner needs to scan each unit individually for it to be entered into the system. An RFID reception device, on the other hand, will pick up on the signals coming from all of the microchips within a given radius. With RFID technology, the task of controlling inventory is made much easier and faster."
