As time becomes less restricted, the environment for different actors to participate in the decision making process becomes more pluralistic, paving the way for secondary actors in U.S. foreign policy making to become more influential. Therefore, a good understanding of which interest groups become more important and when in U.S. foreign policy and how public opinion shapes U.S. leaders’ decision making process is crucial for understanding the main forces behind current policies of the United States in the world."

The doctrine served as the foundation for the Reagan administration’s support of those who were fighting against the Soviet-supported aggression. Based on this doctrine, the Reagan administration not only offered financial and logistical support to the anti-communist opposition in different parts of the world but it also followed a hard line policy against socialist and communist governments in Afghanistan, Angola, and Nicaragua. Indeed, the United States provided covert support to the Contras and the mujahideen in their fight against the leftist left-leaning governments in Nicaragua and Afghanistan, respectively.\n The Reagan Doctrine was the last presidential doctrine of the Cold War period, and it is widely considered to be at least partially responsible for the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War."

    "explanation": "The Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848 that resulted in the annexation of California should be seen in this particular frame. The causes of the Mexican-American War are three-fold. First, President James Knox Polk embraced the idea of “manifest destiny” and offered the Mexican government to sell its large swathes of the southwest land in 1845, but Polk’s offer met with unequivocal refusal of the Mexican leadership (Bauer 1992). Second, Guardino (2017) avers that an increasingly large number of Americans marched towards the southwest of the country in search of fertile land and natural resources including coal, oil, and gold. Mass migration towards today’s California and the Mexican government’s refusal to sell southwestern lands to the US engendered tensions between the two nations. Last, Bauer (1992) argues that the Mexican-American War became inevitable in the wake of the Texas War of Independence, which began in 1835 as an uprising against the Mexican government in the south."

    "explanation": "The causes of the 1898 Spanish-American War were the uprising in Cuba against the Spanish suzerainty and the sinking of the American battleship USS Maine (Chaves 2007). First, the Cuban bid for independence from Spain began in February 1895, which met with fierce clampdown by the Spanish forces on the island. Due to its proximity to the US, the Cuban struggle and Spain’s repressive measures to stifle the rebellion grabbed the headlines in American newspapers and engendered public sympathy for the Cuban rebellion. Furthermore, in accordance with the Monroe Doctrine, the US administrations had long intended to stave off any foreign interference in the continent’s backyard and the Cuban rebellion provided the US leadership with an expedient cause for a new war. Second, the public support for waging a war with Spain over Cuba skyrocketed when the American battleship USS Maine, which was sent to American property and citizens in Cuba in the aftermath of anti-Spanish insurrection in Havana, came under attack and sank (Quesada 2007). While the cause and culprits for the sinking of the USS Maine have remained a mystery to this day, such a provocative incident galvanized the public into support for war as warmongering and flexing American muscle in the Western Hemisphere became a popular chorus in the country."

Although it was viewed as a diplomatic document couched in political and military jargon, the Roosevelt Corollary had Hamiltonian economic rationale, too. The Roosevelt Corollary of 1904 stated that the US would intervene as a last resort to ensure that other nations in the Western Hemisphere fulfilled their obligations to international creditors and did not violate commercial rights of the United States. That said, in the long term, the Roosevelt Corollary played lesser role in regulating the relations between the Western Hemisphere and Europe, yet the corollary did serve as a policy instrument for American intervention in Latin America and the Caribbean."

    "explanation": "The founding beliefs of American foreign policy can be summarized as follows. First, America forms a distinct society from the European society at the time of its independence. Second, America should not get involved with European wars, but trade with all. In the literature, this is generally identified as isolationism. However, as Joyce Kaufman (2017) convincingly argued in her book, it is better to describe this attitude as unilateralism rather than isolationism. This policy does not lead to complete political, economic, and military isolation of the United States, but is led by the United States to choose where and when and to what degree to get involved in the affairs of other countries. Third, the United States should be a beacon of hope for the rest of the world. This idea of “shining city on a hill” is very important for the founding fathers and has shaped the way that the United States perceived itself for its first century and beyond. Lastly, the manifest destiny: The notion of manifest destiny is that it is the destiny of the United States and a God-given right to spread across the North American continent and create what Thomas Jefferson called “the empire of liberty.” The basis of this “empire of liberty” (Wood 2009), according to Jefferson, is republicanism and democracy.\n The correct answer is C."

Roosevelt furthered his arbitration efforts when he played a key role in ending the war between France and Germany in 1906 by convening the Algeciras Conference following the First Moroccan Crisis.

The relations between Britain and the United States remained peaceful afterwards, with the exception of occasional tensions and minor border disputes. As a result of the peace agreement after the War of 1812, Native American threat from the north and west was eliminated as Britain stopped supporting Native Americans against the United States.

    "explanation": "The founding beliefs of American foreign policy can be summarized as follows. First, America forms a distinct society from the European society at the time of its independence. Second, America should not get involved with European wars, but trade with all. In the literature, this is generally identified as isolationism. However, as Joyce Kaufman (2017) convincingly argued in her book, it is better to describe this attitude as unilateralism rather than isolationism. This policy does not lead to complete political, economic, and military isolation of the United States, but is led by the United States to choose where and when and to what degree to get involved in the affairs of other countries. Third, the United States should be a beacon of hope for the rest of the world. This idea of “shining city on a hill” is very important for the founding fathers and has shaped the way that the United States perceived itself for its first century and beyond. Lastly, the manifest destiny: The notion of manifest destiny is that it is the destiny of the United States and a God-given right to spread across the North American continent and create what Thomas Jefferson called “the empire of liberty.”"

Its basic premises are as follows: America is an exceptional nation due to its unique geography, abundant natural resources, lack of aristocracy, civic basis of its nationalism, republican form of government, and its belief in liberty, individualism, and free enterprise. These give the United States a unique position in the world, the proponents of American exceptionalism would argue.

When he got elected to the White House, he made sure the U.S. military presence was felt across the world. Around this period, there were negotiations with Colombia to build a canal that would connect Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. However, the Colombians were reluctant to grant exclusive privileges to the Americans. President Roosevelt was instrumental in supporting the secessionist elites in Colombia, who eventually led to the formation of a small but independent Panama in 1903. The newly independent Panama immediately signed a treaty with the U.S. for building the Panama Canal, and granted the U.S. exclusive rights for five miles (8 km) on either side of the canal, (the Canal Zone) until 1979. This meant the U.S. had a permanent base in the Canal Zone, and full control of the Canal until 1979. After 1979, the jurisdiction switched to a joint commission. Panama could not reclaim total jurisdiction over the Canal Zone until 1999."

A general glance at the Farewell address would give the reader the impression that President Washington was more concerned about domestic issues, such as the unity and harmony of the Union, than the international matters such as military and strategic alliances. Political texts during the early periods of the Republic carried a modest tone. In fact, as a founding father and the third President, Thomas Jefferson envisioned a democratic nation of small farmers, rather than powerful industrialists, who could serve as the agents of the US power globally. Political atmosphere was more inward looking, isolationist than globalist or interventionist. In 1800, President Jefferson explicitly mentioned the virtues of avoiding “entangling alliances.”"

The weakness of central authority and divisions within the military created a power vacuum in Mexico. Territories in the north, particularly Texas, took advantage of this, and decided to secede and go their own way. In 1836, Texas separated from Mexico and declared itself as an independent Republic. However, the ultimate goal was to join the United States as a new state, which they did in 1845."

In the case of Cuba, the U.S. allegedly helped the Cubans to declare their independence from Spain. However, the Americans placed a clause in the constitution of the newly independent island nation that essentially granted guardianship of the US over Cuba. The Platt Amendment had the following provisions: “That the government of Cuba consents that the United States may exercise the right to intervene for the preservation of Cuban independence, the maintenance of a government adequate for the protection of life, property, and individual liberty, and for discharging the obligations with respect to Cuba imposed by the treaty of Paris on the United States, now to be assumed and undertaken by the government of Cuba.”"

Profound social changes in Europe brought about by a population explosion which began in the late 18th century, the Industrial Revolution and its social impact, engendered, in turn, new doctrines such as socialism, communism and the ever carrier of all types of mass frustration, nationalism. These factors culminated behind a number of existing intraEuropean rivalries -i.e. French-German conflict over Alsace-Lorraine, German-Russia competition over the Middle East, traditional Ottoman-Russia antagonism, Balkan nationalism towards AustroHungarian and Ottoman Empires, German-British rivalry over naval power etc.- turning the continent into a powder keg that a small spark could ignite. Against this background, technological advances leading to military developments and the growth of an interlocking system of alliances initiated by the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck were to act as the catalysts leading to World War I (Stokesbury, 1981, 11-19). Europe’s major nations had indeed grouped themselves into two main alliances opposed to each other -Central Powers, composed of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy and the Triple Alliance of Great Britain, France, and Russia."

    "explanation": "When on June 28, 1914, a Serbian nationalist named Gavrilo Princip assasinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Hapsburg throne, and his wife, visiting Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, no one imagined that it would trigger a chain of events drawing Europe into a world war and the United States into a new era in its foreign relations (Bagby, 1999, 18). A former Ottoman province, Bosnia had been annexed by Austria in 1909 and this had antagonized neighboring Serbia - also former Ottoman territory- that had hoped to annex it by itself, retaliating by promoting revolution among national minorities within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Consequently, Austrians understandably suspected the Serbian government of conspiracy and decided to punish Serbia by invading it on July 28. Russian and French mobilization followed that with a view to defend Serbia, Germany’s declaration of war on them, Britain’s entry into war as part of the Allies, and finally Ottoman Turkey’s, on the side of the Central Powers. By August 1914, World War I had begun.\n On August 4, 1914, President Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921), then much more interested in domestic than foreign affairs and largely endorsed by his people, declared that the United States would remain “impartial in thought as well as in action”."

A $ 400 million package of military and economic aid to both countries was proposed by the President and voted by Congress that day. This is recognized as the definitive end of the politics of isolationism.\n What would follow was the European Recovery Program, known as the Marshall Plan, announced by Secretary of State Marshall in a 5 June, 1947 speech at Harvard University to help ensure Europe’s survival, given its “economic, social, and political survival”. Over the four and a half years of the Marshall Plan, America gave more than 1 percent of its GDP in aid, a total of $13.5 billion by June 1952. England received $3.2 billion, France $2.7 billion, Italy $1.5 billion and Germany $1.4 billion. In the words of British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, this was “generosity beyond belief” ( Bagby, 1999, 153), but also a visionary policy, since the two defeated powers of the Axis were also included in this massive geopolitical investment of the Cold War, leaving behind the scars of World War II."

The reason was Roosevelt’s explicit choice of Realpolitik over Moralpolitik. He indeed believed that the United States ought to be a great power rather than a messianic one. Skeptical about international law and the newly emerging concept of disarmament, he developed what came to be known as the “Roosevelt Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, proclaiming the right of the United States to intervene in the Western Hemisphere, against the interference of outside - meaning European colonial- powers as well as to protect US interests."

    "explanation": "When on June 28, 1914, a Serbian nationalist named Gavrilo Princip assasinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Hapsburg throne, and his wife, visiting Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, no one imagined that it would trigger a chain of events drawing Europe into a world war and the United States into a new era in its foreign relations (Bagby, 1999, 18). A former Ottoman province, Bosnia had been annexed by Austria in 1909 and this had antagonized neighboring Serbia - also former Ottoman territory- that had hoped to annex it by itself, retaliating by promoting revolution among national minorities within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Consequently, Austrians understandably suspected the Serbian government of conspiracy and decided to punish Serbia by invading it on July 28. Russian and French mobilization followed that with a view to defend Serbia, Germany’s declaration of war on them, Britain's entry into war as part of the Allies, and finally Ottoman Turkey’s, on the side of the Central Powers. By August 1914, World War I had begun."

However, after Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 and Britain and France responded by declaring war, Congress passed the Neutrality Act of 1939 ending the munitions embargo on a “cash and carry” basis.

    "explanation": "When he became president, Truman knew nothing about the Manhattan Project.

Once it was successfully tested in the New Mexico desert in July 1945, the top scientists involved in the project and who had pleaded with President Roosevelt to build an atomic bomb, opposed the committee’s recommendation on humanitarian grounds, joined by a handful of civilian and military officials who argued that Japan was about to collapse anyway. But President Truman held firm, willing to end the war quickly, worried about the fierce Japanese resistance on Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and fearing a bloodbath in case of a full-scale invasion of the Japanese islands. On August 6, 1945, planes from the 59th Composite Group dropped the first uranium bomb (known as “Little Boy”) on the city of Hiroshima, killing an estimated 140,000 people. As Japan did not immediately surrender, a plutonium bomb (this one nicknamed “Fat Man”) was dropped on Nagasaki three days later, killing 70,000 more. Japan capitulated on August 12."

This was the political conceptualization of the physical and geopolitical isolation that characterized the young republic. Surrounded by unthreatening neighbors in the North and the South (Canada and Mexico) and vast oceans in the East and the West (the Atlantic and the Pacific) the American continent was isolated and self-sufficient, endowed as it was with rich natural resources that allowed a rapid economic and industrial growth. Marking the period 1865-1912, the take-off of the US industrial complex transformed not only the nation’s society but also set the foundations of its foreign policy: the objectives of this generation of Americans was conquering overseas markets and acquiring a series of naval bases and island protectorates that could guard the routes to those markets and, if necessary, could provide the military forces to win conflicts that would /did erupt over those markets (Lafeber, 2013, Preface). This quest for markets, and source for raw materials was later termed as the quest for an “informal empire” (Mc Cormick, 1990, title) with an exclusively economic preoccupation and -unlike European colonialism- no direct geopolitical aim whatsoever.

Bliss, 21 members of The Inquiry, and Henry White, a career diplomat who was the only Republican in the group as neither a member of the Republican-controlled Senate nor any prominent Republican was included. This was amply criticized in the United States as well as the fact that President Wilson himself was engaging his reputation directly by attending the conference, thus taking the risk of being implicated in the eventual failures of a peace treaty - a criticism not totally unfounded. The reasons lying behind the President’s decision included his desire of contributing personally to the new international order he had already sketched in the Fourteen Points and his fear that the victorious camp would care more for vindication over Germany than establishing a just peace, thus relegating the expectations of peace by people all over the world to a secondary concern (Clements, 1999, 197-198). Experience would show that his apprehension too was not unfounded and that the peace treaty would only partially reflect the principles laid out in the Fourteen Points. <strong>The first antagonism between Wilsonian America and colonial Europe manifested itself over the scope of self-determination:</strong> while Point V of XIV envisaged an equitable and human solution to colonial claims as Wilson’s wish was to place former colonies under the administration of small, neutral nations like Holland or Sweden and the supervision of the future international organization until their independence, major European powers objected to that.

Seizing power either by way of popular elections (as in Nazi Germany) or violent revolution (as in Bolshevik Russia), both right and left totalitarianisms were mobilized against the theory and praxis of liberalism, erecting the State as the key institutional apparatus and imposing undiluted nationalism as ideology, with class or race as the defining terms of their respective struggles.

Roosevelt (1933-1945) inherited the Great Depression, who was a Harvard graduate Democrat from a patrician family linked to the former President Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt and himself appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy twice by President Wilson. At the time of his inauguration, national income had halved, the banking system had collapsed and unemployed people were standing in breadlines, with the most desperate ones committing suicide. While the President tried to raise spirits by his eloquence and buoyant personality, he immediately undertook action. In what was called the First Hundred Days, no less than fourteen presidential messages were issued, fourteen historic laws promulgated, and a hundred days later, the New Deal was launched (Leff in Brinkley and Dyer, 2004, 344-351). Opposed to the traditional American political philosophy of laissez-faire, the New Deal generally embraced the concept of a governmentregulated economy aimingat achieving a balance between conflicting economic interests. This was an experimental policy based on governmentdirected programs for creating jobs, reviving industrial activity, and guaranteeing minimum social security for the American people through various new federal agencies and social measures, while strengthening the labor unions.

Instead, he proposed an international trusteeship that would lead to eventual independence Vietnamese. This proposal was flatly<br/>rejected by the French and British. When Ho took it upon himself to declare Vietnam’s independence, a band struck up the Star-Spangled Banner (Patti). Ho’s speech quoted liberally from America’s own Declaration of Independence: Compatriots of the entire nation assembled: “We hold truths that all men are created equal, they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” This immortal statement is extracted from the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776.

Carter suspended military aid to Chile, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Uganda for human-rights abuses. He returned the Panama Canal and maintained good relations with the USSR. However, a more aggressive Soviet posture, culminating with the invasion of Afghanistan, forced Carter’s hand. Already by 1978, Carter announced that while he wanted to “increase our collaboration with the Soviet Union…. [they] can choose either confrontation or cooperation. The United States is adequately prepared to meet either choice (Carter, 1978: 1050-57).” By 1980, America boycotted the Moscow Olympics, embargoed grain and ended the SALT II negotiations. With his National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, providing a new, bolder vision for Carter, the President laid out his foreign policy doctrine at the State of the Union speech in January 1989. Brzezinski, a Polish émigré, was under no illusions when it came to Soviet policy and advocated a hard stance against their recent aggression. “Let our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force (Carter, 1980).” Détente was over."

    "explanation": "Kennedy, like Eisenhower before him, shared a distrust of the military and sought to bring it firmly under the civilian authority of McNamara. When Cuba fell to communist rule under Fidel Castro, the CIA made over one hundred attempts on Castro’s life, in violation of the UN Charter. In 1975, in the wake of the Watergate scandal, the Senate formed the Church Committee (chaired by Frank Church) to investigate CIA assassination attempts against foreign leaders. The Committee confirmed eight attempts against Castro between 1960 and 1965, some of which included the use of the Mafia. The Committee also revealed the CIA had engaged in illegal wiretapping, domestic surveillance and human experimentation. The Cubans themselves put the total number of assassination attempts at 638. The most embarrassing CIA fiasco was the Bay of Pigs in 1961. Kennedy inherited the plan from the Eisenhower administration. The CIA, operating on a 13-million-dollar budget, recruited 1,400 Cuban exiles, including many spies for Castro. Kennedy, who was afraid of America’s involvement becoming public, made frequent last-minute changes, particularly the location of the invasion and the decision to call off air strikes. Castro’s forces had little trouble capturing or killing the brigade of exiles, caught on coral reefs and mangrove trees, and exposed to withering gunfire from the air and the jungles. Ultimately, the whole scheme became public, and it became apparent that the United States had lied at the UN about its involvement (Jones, 2008)."

The new Soviet premier, Mikhail Gorbachev, was departure from the Soviet old guard, who had been dying off in rapid succession during the early 1980s. When Gorbachev came to power in 1985, he was young, dynamic and willing to experiment. Crucially, he recognized that reform was needed. He offered up “glasnost” (openness) and “perestroika” (restructuring). The Soviets needed to reduce its military costs. To the West, he was a man we could do business with. The two leaders met in October 1986 in Reykjavik. While the summit Stagflation - Usually economic production stagnates, or an economy growing too rapidly leads to inflation. The 1970s experienced these two phenomena together. 123 American Foreign Policy did not produce any breakthroughs, largely because of Reagan’s unwillingness to negotiate away SDI research, it did pave the way for the Washington Summit in December 1987. There the Intermediate Nuclear Force (INF) Treaty was signed, the only one of its kind eliminating an entire class of nuclear weapons (National Security Archive). At both summits, Gorbachev was willing to go much further than the Americans in eliminating nuclear weapons and sought genuine collaboration on ending the war in Afghanistan.

      "E": "The Soviets decided to blockade Berlin."
    },
    "explanation": "The first test of containment came from Greece. Its royalist dictatorship had long been closely supported by Britain but had now slipped into a civil war with communist insurgents. Britain was no longer equipped to cope. Britain and the United States saw the war as a test by the newly empowered Soviet Union, carrying out a policy of global expansionism. In fact, Greek Communists were funded by Marshall Josip Tito of Yugoslavia, not Stalin, who adhered to his earlier understanding with Churchill (Lane, 2009). Soviet-Turkish tensions were likewise rising over whether to internationalize the Turkish Straights. Recognizing that Britain was no longer able to protect the Greek government from a communist insurgency, Truman went to Congress with a bold request. He told a joint session of Congress that American reconstruction and military aid was imperative if Greece was to survive as free nation."

It stood as both a physical and symbolic barrier. It served as a reminder that the Soviet system was a failure if the only way to retain its citizens was to lock them behind a wall. Both the Carter and Reagan administrations supported Eastern European dissidents. In the Soviet Union, Helsinki Watch Groups sprouted to monitor the Soviet compliance to the Helsinki Accords."

      "D": "America intervened openly in the overthrow of Arbenz in 1954.",
      "E": "America strongly supported the economic development of Latin America."
    },
    "explanation": "While America cast the Cold War as a struggle between democratic free nations and totalitarian communism, in reality, the choice was less clear. As in the case of Vietnam, democratic elections might lead to a communist government, which then may come under the sway of the Soviet Union, who could manipulate the levers of power towards permanent rule. On the other side, the leader who supports private property or American interests may also have authoritarian tendencies. Jean Kirkpatrick, President Ronald Reagan’s ambassador to the UN, argued there was a fundamental difference between authoritarian government (dictator on the right), and totalitarian (dictator on the left) -- authoritarian governments can eventually reform into democracies, totalitarian dictators cannot (the Kirkpatrick Doctrine). Moreover, authoritarian dictators have greater respect for private property and market forces (Kirkpatrick, 1983). America placed a greater importance on private property than free elections. Nowhere are these principles more clearly demonstrated than America’s policies towards Latin America."

In October 1944, Churchill and Stalin sat down in Moscow to do some “practical arithmetic,” that is, dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. The Soviets were given majority influence in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. Greece went to Britain and they divided Yugoslavia fifty-fifty. Whether the agreement was binding is a matter of some debate; however, Stalin never lent his support to Greek communists and Yugoslavia charted a course independent of both the Soviet Union and the West.<br/>According to the 'Percentage Agreement' Churchill and Stalin were in the same opinion that the Soviets would get the majority influence in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. Greece would go to Britain and they divided Yugoslavia fifty-fifty. Therefore, the correct choice is A."

Except for Juan Peron’s rule in Argentina, these states were reliable partners of the U.S., conveniently forming the largest voting bloc in the UN.

Thus, Allende ruled for the next three years, continuing the policies of his predecessors of fully nationalizing the copper industry and expropriating land and redistributing it among the poor. Copper was the primary U.S. investment in Chile."

    "explanation": "The Truman administration believed that communism spreads on economic misery; democracy, on a successful and prosperous foundation of capitalism. Europe experienced a crippling winter in 1946-47. Their economy was only two-thirds of its pre-war level. There was no definitive approach on how to handle Germany in the peace. The task of rebuilding Europe was monumental despite the far-reaching reforms of Bretton Woods. The IMF and World Bank were simply inadequate - and it was in the Soviet interest to prolong misery in Western Europe. Communist partisans played a key role in defeating the fascists in Italy and France. After the war, their ranks were large and politically influential. Central to the problem was the dollar gap, that is, Europe needed from the United States wheat, coal, machinery, sugar, but it did not have the money to pay for it. Moreover, the United States was so well supplied, it needed little from Europe. Faced with the very real fear that the communists would capitalize on Western European impoverishment to further their gains, Truman scrapped any last vestiges of the Morgenthau Plan and requested $17 billion in funds (with $12 billion ultimately allocated and spent, or 100 billion in today’s dollars). This came to be known as the Marshall Plan. Most funds went to the economic engines of Europe: Britain, France and West Germany. The Marshall Plan was a living demonstration of the economic might and success of the capitalist model. By 1950, Western Europe exceeded its pre-war production by 25 percent"

The two leaders met in October 1986 in Reykjavik.

There the Intermediate Nuclear Force (INF) Treaty was signed, the only one of its kind eliminating an entire class of nuclear weapons (National Security Archive). At both summits, Gorbachev was willing to go much further than the Americans in eliminating nuclear weapons and sought genuine collaboration on ending the war in Afghanistan. For his part, Reagan pushed hard on human rights violations, as delineated by the Helsinki Accords."

As President Bush’s term neared its end, a clearly defined direction for U.S. foreign policy was still far from clear. Several options were available to the policy-makers and analysts within the U.S. administration and outside. There were mainly four grand strategies. First was a retreat from global leadership.

Clinton asserted that “foreign and domestic policy are inseparable in today’s world. If we’re not strong at home, we can’t lead the world we’ve done so much to make. And if withdraw from the world, it will hurt us economically at home”. For Clinton, this interrelationship was very much to do with the U.S. global leadership, which would flow from “our ability to take care of our own at home that gives us the strength to stand up for what we believe around the world”. Clinton argued that in discussing domestic and foreign policies, policymakers created a false choice - one that he would remove. In that sense, he aspired to create a balance between domestic and foreign policies.<br/>Clinton asserted that “foreign and domestic policy are inseparable in today’s world. If we’re not strong at home, we can’t lead the world we’ve done so much to make. And if withdraw from the world, it will hurt us economically at home”. Therefore, the correct choice is B."

After the invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi leader massed his army along Kuwait’s border with Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia was not only a close U.S. ally, but also strategically very important given the high scale of Saudi oil production. With Kuwait and Saudi oil, Hussein would have controlled 40 percent of the world’s oil reserves. In addition, the stability of the post-Cold War balance of power in the region was also at stake. The U.S. could not pull back at a time when the stability of its allies in the region, including Israel, were at risk.

    "explanation": "The Somalia experience taught an important lesson to President Clinton about deployment U.S. forces to far-off countries that had no obvious links<br/>to U.S. national interests. For instance, in the wake of its failure in Somalia, the Clinton Administration chose not to intervene in the Rwandan genocide<br/>in 1994 (Kaufman, 2017: 130). Furthermore, in May 1994, President Clinton signed a Presidential Decision Directive that aimed to limit U.S. involvement in UN peacekeeping operations and therefore introduced new conditions on support to these operations."

    "explanation": "In terms of the fight against international terrorism, 9/11 terror attacks changed the American way of war. An influential foreign policy doctrine was created by Powell and Weinberger. The Weinberger-Powell doctrine indicated that the United States should engage in military action only when it is vital to its national interests, it has a clearly defined exit strategy and has the strong support of the American people. Before 9/11, America had a classic way of war which consisted of (1) overwhelming mass, (2) wide-ranging mobility, (3) high-tech weapons system, and (4) high public support of the war effort. The greatest example of this kind of classic American way of war happened during World War I and Persian Gulf War.\n<br/>With the emergence of international terrorism and the challenge from guerillas and insurgents, Americans realized that their conventional war methods have failed them. This realization first happened with the Korean and Vietnam<br/>Rumsfeld’s “project of military transformation” removed the classic American way of war.

    "explanation": "Why did the US fail in Middle East and specifically in Iraq? One of the reasons was the military transformation project by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Even though the US armed forces were very successful against Saddam’s army, they were unsuccessful in the counterinsurgency war and maintaining stability and security in the post-war period in Iraq.This was due to several reasons. Firstly, Rumsfeld’s forces lacked the necessary military personnel per civilian which was needed to establish security and deter the insurgency. The ratio was 20 soldiers for every 1000 civilian in Iraq. Secondly, the USA’s traditional allies were marginalized and insulted by the American administration during this period. Thirdly, one of the first things that US army did in this period was abolishing the entire army and other security forces of Iraq since they were believed to be Saddam’s instrument."

    },
    "explanation": "The US policy towards China has changed significantly since the establishment of People’s Republic of China in 1949. As China deferred Soviet Union as the leader of the communist bloc in the 1950s and later involved in the Vietnam war (Pillsbury 2016: 57), the United States believed China was an aggressive and expansionist power threatening the security of its non communist neighbors. Hence, for the first twenty years (1949-1969) the US followed a containment policy with China (University, 2009). In other terms, the US tried to disrupt, destabilize and weaken the communist government by constructing an offshore line of military alliances along eastern and southern borders of China such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan."

After the invasion, Iraq became a safety hub for terrorist organization all around the world to gather and train together which became a huge concern for the neighboring states. The initiative comprised of six regional states and its first meeting was held in Istanbul, Turkey on January 2003. Fifth, the failure in the Middle East entrapped and faded US democratic idealism and its fantasies of democracy and reconstruction in Iraq (Fawcett 2013: 315)."

    "explanation": "On 13 April 2013, the US Secretary of State John Kerry paid a visit to China and met with Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing. The visit which happened during the Obama administration was perceived as a signal that Bush era concerns with democratization, terrorism and the Middle East were over(Schiavenza, 2013). 9/11 attacks, Iraq war, Afghanistan war and war against international terrorism has diverted the US’ attention from East Asia that is getting stronger and paving the way to becoming the new economic center of gravity. This was one of the main reasons why the United States wanted a pivot to Asia strategy which was considered to be a win-win strategy. China’s rise in East Asia has long been a concern for the United States during this era and became one of the reasons of this initiative.The other reason was the significance of Asia. This was a region where world’s most pressing and prominent issues were occurring such as climate change and nuclear proliferation and this region was still indispensable for functioning of the world economy."

    "explanation": "By the turn of 2000s, the United States was the sole super-power in the world as the Soviet Union was no longer a challenger. America’s supreme position in the world was mainly built on four dimensions: (1) the USA not only had the largest and most advanced economy within the global economy but it was also the driving force of globalization, (2) the USA was not only the sole superpower but it was also a hyperpower, (3) the USA was the only country with the high-tech military power within the globe and was, at the time ,“the leader in the revolution in military affairs”, and (4) the USA was a great example of not only a hard power but also a soft power as well. It was the disseminator of its popular culture throughout the world (Friedman 2015, p. 1). The United States was not only promoting its popular culture but also it was promoting its own values and ideas. Thus, the ideas that conquered the world were “peace, democracy and free markets (Kurth, 2007:150)” and the geography of this empire was partly built on military relations and partly on economic relations (Friedman 2015: 1)."

    "explanation": "Before delving into the consequences of the coming of the American Empire and in order to understand the conditions that lead to it in more detail, it is vital to understand the four perspectives on American Foreign Policy and the rise of neoconservatives. The global imperial project of America was “the outcome of a domestic political struggle.” We can identify four different American foreign policy traditions. These are: (1) Traditional Liberals (also widely known as the Jeffersonian tradition), (2) Traditional Conservatives (also widely known as the Jacksonian tradition), (3) Neoliberals (also widely known as the Wilsonian tradition), and (4) Neo-conservatives (also widely known as the Hamiltonian tradition). The first two traditions are usually addressed as the national perspectives due to their emphasis on the principle of national interest. They argue that the United States should be governed by its national interests, which are the “promotion and protection of the interests of Americans (Kurth, 2007: 155).” The central concern of the Traditional Liberals is that American domestic economy should be enhanced by domestic social reform rather than by engaging in foreign interventions that would disrupt economic prosperity. This tradition is best represented during the Carter administration. The central concern of the traditional conservatives is American national security. They emphasize that national security should be enhanced by national unity rather than engaging in foreign interventions, which are remote from American vital interests. This tradition is best represented during George H. W. Bush administration."
