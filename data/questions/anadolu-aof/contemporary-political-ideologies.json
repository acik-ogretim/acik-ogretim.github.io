People are born with different talents and abilities, resulting in<br/>social inequality as a natural consequence. The ideal of social equality is neither natural nor achievable. Power, status, and property in society have always been unequally distributed. The mutual dependency between different social strata is not only horizontal but also vertical.

    "explanation": "In the historical context of conservative ideology, the ‘modern state’ embodying sovereignty holds great significance. Conservatism has evolved in response to the increasingly centralized power of the modern state, drawing upon history and tradition. At its core lie certain fundamental premises: Conservatives often oppose the notions of a ‘social contract’ and the accompanying ‘state of nature’ invoked to explain the origins and legitimacy of the state. They argue that a healthy functioning societal order must precede any freely entered social contract (Scruton, 1989: 29-30). Rejecting such rationalist constructs as ahistorical, conservatives view the state not as an ‘artificial’ institution based on individual wills but rather as a ‘natural’ component of the organic social order evolving over time (Honderich, 1990):<br/>148 et seq.). To analyze the state, one must eschew abstract rationalist constructs in favor of empirical historical and social practices and institutions, drawing upon accumulated traditions and experiences."

Adam Müller (1779-1829), a staunch admirer of Burke, exerted<br/>significant influence on subsequent generations with his work “Elements of State Administration”<br/>(1810), which elaborated on Burke’s fundamental ideas. Friedrich Carl von Savigny (1779-1861),<br/>while criticizing the concept of natural law, argued that the only valid source of law and government<br/>was Volkgeist (the spirit of the people). Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831), the most influential figure in the German tradition, experienced a phase of liberal-radical enthusiasm for the French Revolution in his youth but later embraced conservatism in his career."

      "E": "Nationalism has been consistent throughout history, with no contradictions or diverse approaches across different societies and conditions."
    },
    "explanation": "The classical understanding of nationalism is generally based on the principle of having “nation” at the center of political organization. Such an understanding has two basic claims. The first one is the idea that human communities are differentiated into unique nations. T he second is the idea that the most appropriate and legitimate form of political administration is based on a certain nation although there are different ethnicities, religious groups, and languages in a country. This classical understanding points out that the borders of a country are equal to the borders of a certain nation. In other words, this understanding is based on the overlap between a nation and citizenship, which forms the basis of today’s nation-states. Contrary to the classical understanding, nationalism is not such a simple phenomenon. On the contrary, the concept of nationalism should not be limited to political, cultural, or ethnic nationalism. Since it has been perceived differently in different societies and conditions,<br/>Correct Answer:<br/>B) The classical understanding of nationalism argues that the nation and political organization should overlap, with the borders of a nation-state coinciding with those of a particular nation."

    "explanation": "Immigration (including forced migration, refugees, asylum seekers, or legal migrants with the purpose of education, or work) is a multi-dimensional issue that has both negative and positive effects on nationalism. Immigration movements, which have shaped the economic, political, and social structure of countries throughout history, continue to increase due to social, political, and economic conflicts in some regions like Africa and the Middle-East. For this reason, the idea of a nation-state, which is based on a particular nation, is transforming into a multicultural and heterogeneous structure due to new immigrants with different backgrounds. On the other hand, anti-foreigner sentiment and strict immigration policies have started to emerge in many countries, especially in Europe because some politicians with extreme nationalist ideologies consider immigrants as a threat to social unity due to integration problems and cultural tensions.

In this century, the ideology of nationalism has begun to spread throughout society with various symbols such as national anthems, flags, patriotism, national ceremonies, and national holidays. Later, the idea of nationalism, which entered school curricula and became widespread through written and visual media, was used by various political groups to influence the masses. Thus, nationalism, which was associated with values such as liberalism, constitutional government, and modernity in the 19th century, was later embraced by conservative, nationalist, and traditional politicians.

    "explanation": "Post-World War II Period: Anti-Colonialism the ideology of nationalism born in Europe spread all over the world over time. The colonial countries in Asia and Africa rose up against the colonial powers and gained their independence, which enabled the idea of nationalism to spread globally because colonial powers were exploiting different nations under their control for their own political and economic interests. For example, the uprisings in Egypt in 1919, the war between England and Afghanistan in the same year, and the Indian rebellions in the Dutch-dominated East Indies occurred during this period (Heywood, 2016). Independence movements against such colonial countries continued increasingly after the Second World War. After 1945, former colonies dominated by European powers (e.g., England, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal) gained their independence through war, or negotiation.

First, the idea of nationalism is sometimes treated as a political doctrine rather than as an ideology.

Indeed, there is an important parallel between the positions of Italy and Germany in modern world history. Neither Italy nor Germany could catch up with the wave of industrialization and economic development that other great European states such as England and France were going through. England and France experienced industrialization and colonialism simultaneously. While both countries have developed economically, they also achieved national unity. On the other hand, Italy and Germany were not only lagging behind in the industrialization process, but also achieved their national unity late. Likewise, these two countries stayed away from colonial wars. This situation caused Italy and Germany to become weaker than England and France, both economically and in terms of political influence.

More than 65 million people fought in the First World War, which spanned much of the world and more than 8.5 million soldiers and at least 6.6 million civilians died. Another feature of this war is that it introduced the concept of “total war” into the literature. The concept of all-out war means transferring all the possibilities and potential of a state to war. In all-out war, the state is organized like a war machine and the distinction between civilians and soldiers disappears. As a result of the First World War, not only societies became militarized but also a wide-ranging hostility emerged between different nations.

Concepts such as equality, freedom, peace and tolerance came to the fore. During this period, rational thought dominated. According to Enlightenment thought, people make decisions rationally and use their minds to understand what is good and right for themselves. In contrast, anti-Enlightenment traditions are based on the assumption that the world is actually based on competition.

Enlightenment thought, which is a product of modernity, led to the emergence of liberalism and socialism, which emphasize rationality and freedom, albeit in different ways. In this respect, the idea that people act freely, in line with their minds, and can control their own destiny, is both the Scottish one that produced liberalism and a common feature of the French Enlightenment ideas that gave rise to socialism. In other words, even though there are significant differences in their evaluation styles, liberalism and socialism share principles such as rationality, humanism, universalism and secularism. However, Nietzsche states that people act in line with their desires rather than their minds. He argued that the main source of motivation here is the will to power.

    "explanation": "It was Mussolini’s efforts that enabled the emergence of fascism as a political movement in Italy as an autocracy (Figure 4.2). The theoretical foundations of the face of fascism reflected in Italy were laid by philosopher Giovanni Gentile (18751944), upon Mussolini’s request (Roberts, 2007, p. 10). Gentile argued that liberal individualism was meaningless and even harmful in the political and economic conditions of Italy. According to him, Italy should unite all its power and concentrate it in the state in order to become a strong state again. Fascism accepts the state as the essential reality of the individual. Apart from the state, individuals as well as groups, political parties, associations, unions, and classes are not considered a subject.

    "explanation": "<strong>RISE OF FASCISM: THE DARKEST CENTURY</strong> Before World War I, there was a very strong socialist movement in Italy, which was just beginning to industrialize. Socialists organized in labor unions were especially effective in industrial cities such as Turin and Milan. The outbreak of World War I led to a split within the socialist movement. While some socialist intellectuals opposed Italy’s entry into the war, another group, including Mussolini, supported the government’s decision to join the war. Mussolini left the socialist Avanti newspaper, where he was editor-in-chief, and became the head of a fascio. In 1915, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action Congress was held under the leadership of Mussolini. At this Congress, attention was drawn to the problems of justice and freedom caused by the great imperialist powers around the world.

    "explanation": "It was argued by the fascists with the concept of Irredentism that the oppressed peoples would achieve freedom if they accepted the sovereignty of the larger nations from which they were descended. Italians especially claimed rights over regions that had historical ties with Italy but were located on the borders of other states. This approach reflected the political strategy of the risergimento concept, which was born in the 19th century and advocated the unification of all Italian-speaking societies under the same state roof. Irredentism was the expansion policy that Italy would follow to “save” its kinsmen in different countries. In this regard, fascism saw war as a necessary and inevitable phenomenon. In order for the state to become stronger and reach its glory that it had during the Roman Empire, it must destroy the obstacles in its path.

After achieving national unity, Germany asked other European countries to leave some regions in Africa to its own colonies. T he regions where today’s Togo and Cameroon are located were left under German control. However, this was not enough for Germany, which fell far behind England and France in terms of economic and political power. As a matter of fact, Germany’s expansionist aims caused the First World War to break out. Losing the war meant real devastation for Germany. Because the Treaty of Versailles signed with Germany contained very harsh provisions.

Fascists oppose the polyphony inherent in democracy and argue that this prevents the nation from acting in harmony. At the same time, fascists claim that democracy is a corrupt system because the demands of the people are constantly disregarded. Mussolini himself directly described fascism as a totalitarian ideology. “Thus understood, Fascism, is totalitarian, and the Fascist State -synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values - interprets, develops, and potentates the whole life of a people.” (1932, p. 2).

Democratic procedures were terminated in fascist regimes, especially in Italy and Germany. Another reason why fascists oppose democracy is the pluralism inherent in democracy. The pluralism inherent in democratic society has been criticized by fascists as leading to the spread of “corrupt” values. In this respect, it is seen that fascism also opposes liberal individualism.

Social Darwinism, which means the application of Darwin’s theory of evolution to social life, claims that there is a natural war between races. According to Social Darwinists, just as the strongest survive in nature, the same applies to societies. They think that hereditarily superior races will last longer in the world. The “natural selection” approach, put forward by Charles Darwin as an extension of the theory of evolution, argues that only the strongest species can survive in nature. According to Darwin, the weak are doomed to disappear over time. Darwin’s cousin, Francis Galton, tried to apply this theory to societies and argued that science could guide the creation of the most superior species of the human race that would be able to survive against others. In this context, according to Social Darwinists, different nations must constantly compete if they want to continue their existence on the stage of history. The energy generated by this competition will enable humanity to move forward. In this process of struggle and competition, the extinction of those left behind is an inevitable phenomenon."

In all scientific institutions, especially universities, emphasis is placed on the development of military technology. More importantly, the distinction between civilians and soldiers in social life disappears. The aim is for the entire society to think and live like soldiers.

Modern feminism includes Liberal Feminism, Cultural Feminism, Socialist Feminism, and Radical Feminism. The second mainstream is Postmodern Feminism and the third one Ecological Feminism.

    },
    "explanation": "Socialist feminism differs from other feminist movements as it deals with the historical reasons for women’s unequal situation and social position compared to men. Socialist feminism defends the need to include the class and economic conditions of women into the analysis along with the gender approach to explain the position of women in society. Within this context, capitalism is the main cause of gender inequality and discrimination for socialist feminists. The basis of the capitalist system is the patriarchal order that oppresses women and ensures the continuation of oppression for centuries. While the patriarchal social order produces gender-based inequalities for women in almost every aspect of their lives through gender based prejudices, expectations, and roles to be fulfilled, the capitalist system causes women’s labor to be further exploited in the production relations by reinforcing these inequalities in the name of capital accumulation. Therefore, looking from the socialist feminist perspective, the secondary position of women compared to men should be evaluated by considering the patriarchal structure and capitalism together."

    "explanation": "While ecologism provides the scientific and philosophical basis for environmentalism, the green movement has a practical function, translating ecologism’s ideals into tangible actions within the existing system (Georgiev, 2021). Environmentalism, in turn, serves as the central framework incorporating all concerns and efforts linked to the environment. Despite their shared goals, there are some vital differences between these concepts. Ecologism encourages a radical and transformative attitude, pursuing major societal changes. The green movement, on the other hand, assumes a more moderate and reformist standpoint, working within the standing system. Environmentalism includes both perspectives, offering a bigger platform for a variety of approaches and initiatives."

    "explanation": "Kyoto Protocol (1997) demanded industrialised nations set ambitious targets, aiming for a 5.2% reduction below 1990 levels to be achieved by 2012. The Protocol was deemed ground-breaking as it extended beyond its numerical goals and introduced innovative market mechanisms like emissions trading and the Clean Development Mechanism to facilitate flexible and cost-effective conformity. Despite the ambitious intentions mentioned above, the Protocol initially excluded major emitters like the United States, China, and India, and compliance of most countries varied dramatically among signatory countries. Additionally, the briefness of the first commitment period exposed limitations in adapting to evolving scientific understanding and political landscapes."

All the while the truth was that the Agreement was supposed to empower individual nations to determine their own nationally determined contributions (NDCs).

Naess argued for the intrinsic value of nature and made a solid point for humanity’s moral responsibility to protect the environment. Naess’ ideas to combine humanity and its moral responsibility was new but also timely and profound. His novel ideas started to resonate deeply within environmental circles, inspiring those who were concerned to demand a re-evaluation of humanity’s relationship with the natural world."
