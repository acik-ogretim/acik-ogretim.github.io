The drawback of this approach is that a head office planner may not have a deep understanding of a business unit’s activities in order to perform the environmental scanning.\n<br/><strong>Separate organizational unit: </strong>Company sets a separate organizational unit which is responsible for disseminating relevant information to managers. For instance, General Electric company uses such a system. A dedicated team concentrating its efforts on environmental scanning is the advantage of separate organizational units, but it is very costly for small and/or not-for-profit organizations.\n<br/><strong>Joint line/general management teams: </strong>To identify needs, trends and issues that may affect business, a temporary planning team is set up. These teams are made of line and general (corporate) management."

There are many price-adjustment strategies including <strong>dynamic pricing, psychological pricing, discount and allowance pricing, segmented pricing, geographical pricing, promotional pricing, and international pricing</strong>. In <strong>dynamic pricing</strong>, prices are being adjusted continually to maximize revenue. For example, prices are changing thousands times a day in the airline sector. In <strong>psychological pricing</strong>, prices are adjusted based on a psychological viewpoint rather than economic perspective. For example, companies consider price thresholds in consumers’ mind while changing prices for products. <strong>Discount and allowance pricing</strong> refers to a reduction in the price of the products for consumers who buy large quantities or pay early. In <strong>segmented pricing</strong>, prices are differentiated based on customer, location, or product rather than cost. For example, although cost of providing a hotel room does not change, rooms with a sea view are more expensive than the rooms without a good scenery. <strong>Geographical pricing</strong> refers to setting prices for customers who are in different locations in order to cover high shipping costs. For instance, lower prices are charged for customers who are close to oil refinery while higher prices are charged for ones who are far away. <strong>Promotional pricing</strong> means reducing prices for a while to increase short term sales. The prices are set below list price. <strong>International pricing</strong> refers to setting prices for different countries. For example, a company may charge different prices for different countries, or it may set a fixed price for every country. Therefore, the correct option is A."

    "explanation": "Companies started to set prices by considering the whole marketing mix rather than just the product itself. In this way, profits can be maximized. There are different product mix pricing strategies including product line pricing, byproduct pricing, optional-product pricing, captiveproduct pricing and product bundle pricing. In product line pricing, company sets different prices for the products in line. For example three different price levels may be set for three models of basic t-shirts. By-product pricing involves products produced unintentionally as an output of the manufacturing process of the main product. These kinds of products have no (or little) value such as sawdust. Optional-product pricing refers to accessory products sold with the main product. For example, consumers may buy steel rims or parking sensor along with a car. Captive-product pricing refers to complementary products which are used with the main product such as printer cartridge, so the company may get higher profits from the sales of cartridges. In product bundle pricing, less demanded products are sold together with highly demanded ones at a discounted price. The aim of the strategy is to promote less demanded products.
