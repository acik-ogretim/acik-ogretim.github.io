    "explanation": "Any entry made on the left side of the account is a debit (abbreviated Dr.), and any entry made on the right side is a credit (abbreviated Cr.). These terms are used to describe the place of entries in recording process not for “increase” or “decrease”. For example, entering an amount on the left side of an account is called debiting while crediting refers to the act of making an entry on the right side of an account. Also, if the sum of the left side exceeds the sum of the right side of an account, a debit balance occurs. other words, debit balance shows the difference between total amounts of the left and the right side where debit amount exceeds the credits. In reverse situation, when the credit amount exceeds the debits, credit balance occurs. Credit balance shows the difference between total amounts of the right and the left side where credit amount exceeds the debits."

    "explanation": "The accounting equation provides the analytical framework that we use throughout this book to understand the effects of transactions and events on the financial statements. This equation requires that a company’s assets exactly balance, or offset, an equal amount of financing provided by creditors and owners of the corporation. Each transaction must affect two or more accounts to keep the basic accounting equation in balance. In other words, for each transaction, one or more accounts must be debited, or entered on the left side of the account, and one or more accounts must be credited, or entered on the right side of the account, and the total monetary amount of the debits must equal the total dollar amount of the credits. The equality of debits and credits provides the basis for the double-entry system of recording transactions. Under double-entry system, debit and credit procedure is used to keep the accounting equation in balance by using appropriate accounts instead of using plus and minus procedure."

Expenses incurred but not yet paid or recorded at the end of the accounting period are accrued expenses. Accrued expenses are the ones that are firstly incurred and not recorded as an expense until a future accounting period. Because of the unnecessity, such kinds of expenses are not required for daily recordings. For that reason, companies do not recognize them until the preparation of financial reports.<br/>The amount of such an accrued but unpaid item at the end of the accounting period is both an expense and a liability. At each statement date, companies make the necessary adjustment entries related with accrued expenses. Before the adjustments, liabilities and expenses are understated. So in adjusting entry, expense account will be debited and a liability account will be credited.<br/>The correct answer is A."

    },
    "explanation": "The time-period concept assumes that unlimited economic life of a company will be divided into regular intervals and that financial statements will be prepared for specific periods such as a month, quarter, or year. Each company is set up with the expectation that it will have an unlimited lifetime (remember the going concern assumption). But companies’ related parties (such as government, creditors, investors, management, customers, etc.) wish to have information about the activities and financial position of the company over certain periods. In order to meet these demands and give feedback, the unlimited economic lifetimes are divided into artificial time periods by accountants. The time-period concept (or alternatively periodicity concept) assumes that unlimited economic life of a company will be divided into artificial time periods and that financial statements can be prepared for specific periods such as a month, quarter, or year."

    "explanation": "It is important to know when companies should recognize revenue, in other words, when the companies earned the revenue. Revenue recognition principle will guide us. But first of all we will start with the definition of revenue and expense terms. Revenue is the gross inflow of economic benefits during the period arising from the course of the ordinary activities of an entity when those inflows result in increases in equity, other than increases relating to contributions from equity participants. Expense is outflows or other using up of assets or incurrences of liabilities during a period from delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or carrying out other activities that constitute the entity’s ongoing major or central operations."

This process will begin with the trial balance. This trial balance is unadjusted because the accounts are not yet ready to prepare the financial statements. The reasons as follows:<br/>1. Some financial events are not recorded on a day-to-day basis because it is unwise to do so such as consumption of supplies or the earnings of salaries by employees.<br/>2. Some costs are not recorded during the current accounting period because these costs expire with the passage of time rather than as a result of recurring daily transactions such as rent expense or insurance expense.<br/>3. Some types of expenses may be unrecorded. For example, an electricity bill may not be received until the next accounting period."

By accounting meaning, the revenue accounts and expense accounts have to be closed and their balances have to be posted to Income Summary account. Because the company has so many different revenue and expense accounts separately, they have to be accumulated under one account in order to figure out the exact result. This account is the Income Summary account. After the accumulation of revenues and expenses under Income Summary account, the final result is clear. <br/>Transferring the balances of the revenue and expense accounts to Income summary account, and transferring Income Summary account’s balance to Capital account are called the “Closing Entries”.

The first factor that limits the choice of companies is the requirements of regulatory bodies. LIFO is forbidden by most of the regulators especially by the ones in hyper-inflationary economies. The other factor which affects the decision made is the purpose of the company. In other words, if the company is planning to sell its shares in the market, then it wants to be evaluated as a profitable company and would prefer to choose the method which will show its financials in a more profitable way. On the other hand, if a company wants to pay less tax, then it would prefer to choose the method which will show the company less profitable."

The specific identification method is impractical unless each unit can be identified accurately. This costing method is best for businesses that sell unique, easily identified inventory items, such as jeweler (a specific diamond earring), an automobile dealer (each automobile has a unique serial number) and real estate (identified by address).

    "explanation": "Normally, companies collect account receivables in cash and remove it from the books simultaneously. However, in recent years as credit sales and receivables have grown considerably, some companies have started to sell their receivables to other companies in order to accelerate receipt of cash from receivables. The most practiced method to sell receivables is the sale to a factor, also called as factoring. Factoring arrangements vary extensively. However, factors (the buyer of the receivables) charge a fee or commission for their services. In today’s world, many businesses have reduced their investments in receivables by encouraging customers to pay via credit cards such as Visa or Master. The credit card companies pay these businesses and later bill the customers. The working of debit cards is slightly different than the working of credit cards. Using a debit card is similar to paying with cash, except that the customers will not have to carry cash with them. When debit card is swapped by retailer at the point of sale terminal (POS) or cash counter, the bank balance of the customer is automatically reduced and the amount is transferred to retailer’s account."
