Then, subsequent years’ levels are calculated according to this 100 value.<br/>General price level is the index value of weighted average of goods’ prices in a specified period of time.

    "explanation": "According to Keynes’ basic opinion, fiscal policy can be used to stabilize the fluctuations in production and employment. Government should decrease taxes and/or rise expenditures to avoid the economic recession (expansionary fiscal policy). On the contrary, in an inflationary period, government should rise the taxes and/or decrease expenditures to lower the inflation rate (contractionary fiscal policy).<br/>If any government decrease taxes and/or rise expenditures to avoid the economic recession, that basically means expansionary fiscal policy.

Inflation is the general increase in all prices in the economy. However, it is necessary to separate the increase of a single good’s price from the increase of all goods’ prices (general price level). As you remember from microeconomics, the price of a single good may change due to fluctuations of that good’s supply and demand. If there is an increase in a single good’s price, it is not correct to consider this as inflation.

    "explanation": "Basic Concerns of Macroeconomics-Production Growth Rate:<br/>One of the basic indicators used in assessing the performance of an economy and the general economic conditions in a country is the country’s total production, more correctly the rate of change of this quantity according to the previous period. Total production is the total of all goods and services produced in an economy for a given period of time. The rise in the capacity of economy to produce goods and services is called as economic growth. On the other hand, economic growth can be defined as expansion of production possibilities of a country. In this case, economic growth can be considered as outward shift of the country’s production possibilities frontier."

The points discussed are related with how the effects of monetary policy emerge and what the magnitudes of these effects are."

Therefore, in order to calculate net investment amount in the country, amortizations should be subtracted from gross investment amount. The obtained net investment value is a very useful measure indicating how much the capital assets in the country increased. If net investments are positive, due to increase in capital stock, productive capacity will rise. If net investments are negative, due to decrease in capital stock, productive capacity will decrease."

On the other hand, when the capacity utilization rate is low (that is, the number of plants and equipment that are idle in the economy increases), investment expenditures will also tend to decrease."

    },
    "explanation": "Factors that Effect Consumption Expenditures<br/>There are different factors that influence the consumption decisions of households. Some of these factors are not related to income. Changes in factors that affect consumption other than income are changes in autonomous consumption. In this case the consumption function shifts downward or upward as a whole. Now we can turn to principal factors that affect consumption expenditures.<br/>Disposable Income,<br/>Wealth: Wealth is the value of all assets that households have. These include houses, automobiles, bank accounts, stocks and all kinds of assets such as income expected to be obtained in the future. When the wealth of households increases, the available resources that can be allocated for spending increase, too. As a result, the amount of consumption expenditure at each income level will increase.<br/>Expectations: Another important factor for determining consumption is the expectations about future income, prices and wealth. For example, if consumers expect a stagnation in the economy, they expect that they will lose their jobs or their working hours will be reduced. In this case, they will reduce their consumption expenditures and therefore they will save more.<br/>Demographic Factors: When the other factors effecting consumption are assumed to be constant, an increase in population will increase consumption expenditures. Here, both the increase in the number of people in the country and the changes in the age composition of the population have an effect on the consumption expenditures. While the size of the population affects the location of the consumption function, the age composition of the population has an effect on the slope of the consumption function. Other factors being constant, an increase in the size of population leads to an increase in autonomous consumption, and therefore the consumption function shifts upward. Considering the age composition of the population, it is known that the young population spends more on durable consumption goods and therefore the young population has a higher marginal propensity to consume than the elderly population. Since the slope of consumption function is measured by MPC, the rising share of the young people in total population will make consumption function steeper."

    },
    "explanation": "Factors Determining Investments<br/>We have already stated that investment expenditures are made up of expenditures of firms on capital goods and stocks. Capital goods are the equipment they need to carry out production activities and the buildings that firms have. Stocks are composed of final unsold goods. Stocks may be planned or unplanned. For example, a tire firm will start to have enough winter tires in stock from the autumn to meet the winter tire demand which is expected to intensify in the winter months. Otherwise, the firm’s inadequate stock operation can lead to a reduction in sales and loss of revenue. For this reason, the investment made by this firm is a planned inventory investment - that is, a stock change. If the firm wants to keep as few unsold winter tires as possible in its stocks until the month of February, and there are still unsold winter tires in February when it comes, this is an unplanned inventory investment. Unplanned stock changes can be regarded as a sign showing that sales are not as good as expected and that there is too much production in the previous period.<br/>Both types of inventory investments or stock changes are considered investment. However, only planned investments, together with other planned expenditures, are effective in determining the level of equilibrium production in an economy. Unplanned investments and undesirable stock changes do not have any impact on the equilibrium level of income. For this reason, economists are interested in factors that affect planned investments.<br/><strong>Interest Rate</strong>: The investment objective of a firm is to be able to obtain profit from this investment. For this reason, the higher the expected profitability of the investments is, the higher the investment amount will be. The main factor determining whether an investment is profitable is the interest rate. Interest rate can be defined as the cost of borrowing funds. A large part of the investment expenditures made by the enterprises is covered by borrowing. If the cost of borrowing, i.e., interest rate, increases, fewer investment projects will become profitable. Accordingly, when the interest rate increases, investment expenditures will decrease and when the interest rate falls, investments will increase.<br/><strong>Expected Profit</strong>: We have stated that firms are aiming for profit from investing. It is clear that the profit to be gained from an investment that a firm will realize is not certain. For this reason, in order to determine the appropriate amount of investment, firms use economic analyzing techniques to estimate the cost of the investment and the revenue to be obtained from that investment. For this reason, the factor that determines the amount of investment is the expected profitability of investment. There are a number of factors that affect the expected profitability of investments. These include, for example, entry of new firms into the market, political instability in the country, newly enacted laws, taxes or tax advantages provided by the government and general economic conditions in the world.<br/><strong>Technological Change</strong>: One of the main driving forces behind new investments is technological change. Realizing the production of a new product or using a new production technology can be extremely important in terms of staying within the industry. Technology is important for companies as it increases productivity at each stage in production processes. The use of technology also contributes to a reduction in production costs.<br/><strong>Cost of Capital Goods</strong>: Another factor that affects investment expenditures is the cost of capital goods. As the price of capital goods increases, the expected profitability of the investment will decrease and a contraction in investment volume will occur. One of the factors that cause rapid change in the cost of capital goods is the government’s tax policy. The investment incentives provided by the government (i.e., the tax deduction of the cost of the investment) will affect the cost as well as the amount of investment. In this sense, a reduction in the cost of the investment will result in an increase in investment expenditures.<br/><strong>Capacity Utilization</strong>: If a firm intensively uses the capital stock that it owns, it will want to add that stock. However, if part of the current capital stock is idle, the firm does not tend to make any increase in the capital stock it owns. When we look at the economy as a whole, the fact that the current capacity is used at a higher rate will put pressure on the increase of capital goods production and the expansion of productive capacity. On the other hand, when the capacity utilization rate is low (that is, the amount of plants and equipment that are idle in the economy increases), investment expenditures will also tend to decrease."

    },
    "explanation": "Net Export Function<br/>In your textbook, the last column of Table 2.3 contains the <strong><em>net export values defined as the difference between exports and imports</em></strong>. Remember that we assumed export amount as autonomous (independent from domestic income) and imports increase depending on the increase in income. For this reason, <strong>the net export volume will decrease as income increases</strong>. Given this tendency of net export it is possible to draw the net export function (NX) as in Figure 2.6. This tendency of the net export function, which shows a decreasing sloping pattern, is actually equal to the marginal propensity to import.<br/>Another feature of the net export function is that it is the only component that can have a negative value in aggregate expenditures. We have already mentioned that <em><u>the negative net export value can emerge in cases where the import volume of the home country exceeds her export volume.</u></em><br/>Net export function will move up or down depending on changes in income levels, prices of similar goods, preferences of other countries, restrictions imposed by governments on international trade and foreign exchange rates. For example, an increase in the income of other countries causes an increase in the export volume of the home country and by raising the net export volume, it shifts the net export function upward."

      "D": "The reason is that the government expenditures are autonomous.",
      "E": "The reason is that the net export function has a negative slope."
    },
    "explanation": "AGGREGATE EXPENDITURE FUNCTION<br/>The aggregate expenditure function is obtained by summing up each of the planned expenditure functions described above. Aggregate expenditures (AE) are composed of consumption (C), investment (I), government expenditure (G) and net export (NX): AE = C + I + G + NX<br/>The aggregate expenditure function (AE) can also be obtained graphically with the vertical aggregation of individual expenditure functions. If we first draw the consumption function (C) and add the 500 TL planned autonomous investments at each level of income, we obtain the C + I curve. Then if we add 700 TL planned government expenditures at each level of income, we get the C + I + G curve. Finally, by adding the net export function that will be realized at each level of income, the C + I + G + NX curve or the AE function is attained.<br/>When we carefully examine the figure, we see that the functions C, C + I and C + I + G are parallel to each other. This indicates that all of the mentioned functions have the same slope, which is equal to the marginal propensity to consume. That is why I and G are autonomous in the model. On the other hand, the slope of the AE function is smaller than the slope of the other functions. The reason is that the net export function has a negative slope. When we add the NX function to the C + I + G function, the slope of the aggregate expenditure function decreases. For this reason, the AE function is more horizontal than the C + I + G function."

At this point, you can think that the increase in GDP will be equal to the increase in autonomous spending. However, this increase will have more boosting effect than the increase in autonomous expenditure. In other words, the increase in autonomous expenditures creates additional expenditure in the economy, leading to a larger increase in GDP or equilibrium income."

The classical model explains the continuous realization of employment in the economy, based on Say’s Law, which states that “every supply creates its own demand”. According to this law, a certain amount of income is generated as a result of the production of goods and services. This income is used again to buy goods and services. Firms purchase or lease the resources required in the production process. They pay their owners in the form of fees, interest, rents, and profits. The amount that the producers pay to the owners of the production factors has to be equal to the value of the goods and services produced. Here, the production factor consumes all the income that the owners have gained and everything produced is sold. Thus, according to Say’s Law, every supply creates its own demand. It is not the case that the aggregate expenditures are insufficient in terms of full employment level. In some economies, when there is supply surplus or excess demand in some markets, the price mechanism is engaged and the market returns to the equilibrium level again.

What is important here is how the savings will be equal to investments. According to Classical economists, interest rate is the key variable to provide this equality. This interest rate, which is determined on the loanable funds market, will change so as to ensure that the funds provided as a result of savings are equal to the funds requested for investments.

    "explanation": "Equilibrium in Keynesian Model<br/>The views of the classical model which guarantee full employment equilibrium were began to be questioned as a result of the long-term economic stagnation and the associated high unemployment during Great Depression that occurred in the 1930s. In order to solve this problem, British economist John Maynard Keynes argued that the economic equilibrium, as put forward by Classical economists, does not mean that the level of full employment income is provided at the same time. According to Keynes, equilibrium income can be achieved at the level of underemployment or overemployment. What is important here is the level of aggregate demand. Since it is difficult to change the production capacity that determines aggregate supply in the short term, the level of income depends on aggregate demand or aggregate expenditures. In other words, firms give their production decisions according to the expected aggregate expenditure or aggregate demand level. If the economic units plan to spend more, the sales expectations of the companies will increase and they will make more production. As it is seen, Keynes links the deviations from full employment to the inadequacy of aggregate expenditures in the economy. Accordingly, full employment in the economy can be achieved by an adequate level of aggregate expenditure. Then, Keynesian theory criticizes the views expressed by Classics on investment as a function of the interest rate and on wage-price elasticity. The Keynesian theory argue that the economy is not always be at full employment equilibrium because flexible prices and wages are not always valid. According to this opinion, there are many factors that prevent wages and prices from being flexible. For this reason, markets are moving away from fully competitive structure. In some sectors the existence of firms that do not want to reduce prices may be the case. Prices in these sectors can remain at the same level for a long time instead of falling when there is a fall in demand or expenditure. Because of the existence of strong labor unions and long-term wage contracts, the same is also true in labor markets. According to Keynesian model, one reason why equilibrium income is not always at full employment level is that investment and saving equality cannot always be provided as Classics argue. The reason for this is that the economic units that save and invest in the economy are generally different from each other. These economic units give savings and investment decisions for different reasons. For example, when savings for households occur as accumulation for future days, firms’ investment decisions are directed at expanding facilities or purchasing new capital goods to increase their profitability. In this case, it may not happen that savings at an income level that close to full employment equal investments. Savings can also lead to an increase in the amount of money held, rather than being used for financing investments. In this case, savings-investment equality will not be provided again."

      "E": "Saving Paradox is the reduction in the consumption expenditures and, therefore, income because of rising savings."
    },
    "explanation": "Saving Paradox<br/>When the households decide to increase their savings without a change in income level, interesting contradiction called as saving paradox will arise. To understand this situation, we need to answer the question “What if households want to save more today in order to prepare for the difficult days in the future?” For instance, if planned savings of households increase, let’s say 400 TL at every level of income, the total leakages curve (S1 + T + IM) in Figure 3.4 shifts upward to S2 + T + IM position. Planning to increase savings also means planning less consumption at the same time. As a result of the decrease in consumption, aggregate expenditure, i.e., aggregate demand, will decrease. In this case, the decrease in aggregate expenditures leads to an increase in stocks. This increase in stocks will lead to production level of firms and income level to decrease.<br/>Before the increase in savings, the level of equilibrium income was 5,000 TL, expressed by the point D1 where injections line intersects leakages line. Increase in savings shifted equilibrium point to D2 and the new level of equilibrium income is 4,000 TL. As you see, 400 TL increase in savings regarding their beginning values has resulted in a decrease of 1,000 TL in equilibrium income level. When Table 3.2 is considered, the original level of savings was 1,200 TL when equilibrium level of income was 5,000 TL. In the new equilibrium level of income at 4,000 TL, households again save the same amount (1,200 TL) with the beginning value. According to this result, households planning to save more and consume less now, but save the same amount. This is a paradox indicating that increasing saving reduces consumption and, therefore, income; however, at this new income level savings are at the same level. When you consider the fact that savings are used to finance investments in the country, this result contradicts the widespread belief that savings are beneficial for the economy.<br/>Saving Paradox is the reduction in the consumption expenditures and, therefore, income because of rising savings."

The multiplier value is always greater than 1. The reason for this is that the change in autonomous expenditure leads to an additional change in consumption expenditures. Here, the determinant of the size of the Equilibrium in the Economy effect is marginal propensity to consume. As you remember, the marginal propensity to consume gives us how consumption rises when income rises. For example, the primary effect of 1 unit increase in autonomous expenditure would be to increase production and income by 1 unit. If the marginal propensity to consume is large, this increase in income leads to a large increase in consumption. In this case the multiplier effect will also be large. If the marginal propensity to consume is small, this increase will lead to a low change in consumption. In this case, the multiplier effect will be small. Based on this value, we find that 100 TL increase in the initial expenditure level leads to an increase of 2.5 times in GDP, that is, an increase of 250 TL (2.5 x 100). If you remember our discussions on leakages and injections above, the rest of the income increase after separating leakages is devoted to domestically produced goods and services, and the ratio of this amount to income increases is measured by marginal propensity to consume (MPC).

    "explanation": "Changes in Public Expenditures and Taxes Together<br/>What happens if government changes public expenditures along with taxes? For instance, if government increases public expenditures and finances this increases via taxes, what would be the effect of these changes? Considering previous examples, we can easily answer this question. As you remember, in the examples above, we calculated if government increases public expenditures 400 TL, income will increase 1000 TL. As in the example of taxes above, if government finances 100 TL of its public expenditure increase of 400 TL, 100 TL increase in taxes will decrease income by 150 TL. If we sum up these two changes, in case of financing increase of public expenditures partly by taxes, we can easily find the net change in income. According to our example, the net effect of public expenditures and taxes on income will be found as 1000 + (-150) = 850 TL<br/>It is necessary to emphasize several points in this calculation. First, the effects of changes in public expenditures and taxes on income are opposite to each other. Second, in terms of absolute value, expenditure multiplier is higher than tax multiplier. The reason is that, change in public expenditures affects aggregate expenditures directly while a change in taxes affects consumption expenditures via disposable income, hence aggregate expenditures indirectly."

As we just mentioned, economic units desire to hold money for three purposes: For transactions, as a precaution and speculatively. According to our explanations above, there are two factors determining the amount of money demanded: Nominal income and interest rate. The Keynesian approach reviewing the relationship between quantity of money and economic activities via indirect channel, accepts money demand (Md) as a function of interest rate (i) in an environment having a constant nominal income rate."

If you have 20 TL in your pocket, you can imagine your purchasing power by thinking about the goods and services you may purchase with this amount of money and understand this function of money easily. This function of money is closely related with the prices of goods and services in the country. For instance, if all prices double right now, the amount of goods and services you can purchase with the money in your pocket cut in half. In other words, your purchasing power with the money in your pocket halves. Contrary, if all prices of goods and services are lowered, then you can purchase more goods and services with the money in your pocket, meaning that your purchasing power increases.

    },
    "explanation": "EVOLUTION OF MONEY<br/>Within the framework of basic functions of it, money took various shapes in time. It is known that many different objects have been used as medium of exchange in various cultures. For example, American natives used whale teeth; tobacco and cow were used in colonial USA, cigarettes were used in German prisoner of war camps during World War II, and gold was used in many countries as mean of payment. It is possible to find more examples of objects used as money in history. In fact, evolution of money from whale teeth to current banknotes can be reviewed basically in two categories: Commodity money and fiat money. Commodity money is the object which has a value when used as goods and which can also be used as medium of exchange. The best example of commodity money is gold. Gold has been used as means of payment to purchase goods and services for centuries; gold also has a value in other usage areas as a good. For instance, gold is being used as jewelry or ornaments for centuries, as well as a means of payment.<br/>In an economy with commodity money, for instance, if both gold and silver coins are in use (in circulation) at the same time, an interesting situation emerges. Since gold as a commodity has a greater value than silver, nobody wants to spend coins in his/her pouch and everyone tries to spend silver coins first. If everybody behaves like that, the money passing from hand to hand will be silver coins and gold coins will stay in people’s pouch. If we call silver coins as bad money and gold coins as good money, we can easily say that bad money drives out good money in the market. This phenomenon is known as Gresham’s Law (Sir Thomas Gresham was sixteenth century financial agent in Britain Kingdom).<br/>The objects having no value as goods but referring to a value in purchasing goods and services are called as fiat money. The paper pieces we use as medium of exchange today has no value as goods. But these papers in your pocket refer to an amount of value equal to the numbers printed on it in purchasing goods and services. The main question to be answered here: “When there are objects having values as a good, why do we accept worthless paper pieces as money?” If the answer is “Because paper money has a value in terms of gold or silver”, let us say that you are wrong. For instance, you cannot exchange paper Turkish Liras with gold. This paper pieces are accepted as money because the government declared them as legal payment tools and you (and other members of community) accepted this declaration. Today, fiat money forms the basis of monetary system in many countries. Fiat money can be in different forms in each country. In section below, we will review kinds of fiat money in economies today."

    "explanation": "Types of Money<br/>Near (Quasi) Money: We included demand deposits into money concept by referring that they are accepted as money by economists in the explanations above. But we know that there are also time deposits in banks as well as demand deposits. This kind of deposits can be withdrawn from bank only after a certain time. Therefore, you can not use your time deposits to make any payment. If you have a time deposit in a bank, you cannot make a payment by writing a check like in demand deposits. Therefore, time deposits are excluded from the money types listed above. In practice, banks generally allow time deposits to be withdrawn before its due date (maturity) like demand deposits. Since banks allow time deposits to be withdrawn before its due date, the difference between time and demand deposits becomes narrower. Although it is not possible to write a check on time deposits, the possibility to convert them to cash or demand deposits anytime causes to think that they have same characteristics. Many financial assets in many countries can easily be exchanged with cash, even not as much as time deposits. For example, in countries experiencing high inflation, the foreign currencies (such as US Dollar or Euro) are generally used to protect purchasing power and easily be exchanged with domestic currency. In fact, most of the time foreign currencies can be used for payments instead of domestic currency. Similarly, treasury bills can easily be exchanged with cash, as well. The possibility and speed of conversion for these type of assets to currency or demand deposit is called as liquidity. Considering the full liquidity of money, many financial assets may have this property more or less, even not exactly. When considering the liquidity property, it is not easy to distinguish monetary things and non-monetary things. This kind of assets having a high liquidity but not used in payments directly are called as near (or quasi) monies."

In the consecutive deposit creation process started by an increase in reserves of the banking system, the demand deposit amount that banking system can create is<br/>calculated with simple deposit money multiplier. Within the framework of simplifying assumptions above, simple deposit money multiplier is equal to the reciprocal of required reserve ratio. In our example, as required reserve ratio is 10 percent, then the reciprocal of it will be<br/>Thus, in our example, the deposit money amount which banking system can create with an increase of 1000 TL in reserve is 10 x 1000 TL = 10.000 TL. If we denote the amount of deposit money which banking system can create, that is, change in in demand deposits, as ΔD, change in reserves of banking system as ΔR and required reserve ratio as r, we can calculate the deposit money amount that can be created with the formula:<br/>The term in parenthesis in this equation above is called as simple deposit money multiplier."

The total amount of these goods and services is measured by real income or real GDP. As you will recall, the general level of prices is expressed by the average weighted index of prices of all goods and services in the economy. For example, the consumer price index (CPI) we are familiar with from our daily lives is an index that measures the change in the general level of prices.

    "explanation": "AD-AS ANALYSIS AND ECONOMIC STABILIZATION POLICIES<br/>Our goal is to assess the impact of economic policies. When analyzing these effects, we should pay attention to two points about AS curve. First of all, we assume that the AS curve does not change. Secondly, we have to pay attention to what region the economy is on the AS curve because the price and production reaction of the economy will be different accordingly. If the economy is operating in the horizontal part of the aggregate supply curve, as in the beginning, an expansionary policy that causes the AD curve to shift to the right leads to a small increase in prices and a large increase in production."

    "explanation": "INFLATION AND ITS CAUSES<br/>Inflation is the increase in the general level of prices. According to this definition, every factor that shifts the AD curve to the right and the AS curve to the left cause inflation. However, we should clarify the difference between one-time price increase and continuous increases in prices. Inflation is the continuous increases in the general price level for a long time. When you consider the explanations we made so far, it is possible to say that there will be a lot of factors that create one-time increase in prices. However, most of the economists today accept that the main factor that drives prices to increase continuously is continuously increasing money supply. This shows that whatever the initial reason to increase price level is, inflation occurs only when<br/>increasing money supply accompanies. Therefore, it is generally accepted in economics that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. After distinguishing one-time price increase and inflation, we can analyze the causes of inflation depending on its basic types."

    "explanation": "The main motive for international trade is to increase the economic gains or benefits not only for the individuals but also for the whole society. At this point, some critical questions arise: How does international trade increase the economic gains ofthe trade partners? How are these economic gains shared? What are the welfare effects of international trade? International trade theories answer these questions. The common assumption of the theories is that international trade increases the welfare via specialization in the most effective production and exchange referring to exports and imports.<br/>When the imports and exports of a country are examined, it would probably be surprising to notice that country imports the commodities which it could produce by itself. So, why do this country imports the commodity instead of producing at home? The answer is simple: A country cannot produce everything because its economic resources are limited. Thus it should produce the most effective commodities. Such a concentration on the most effective commodities and production would lead to specialization and specialization increases the total output and welfare.<br/>International trade which has deeply penetrated to our ordinary daily life has a comprehensive theory dating back to the seventeenth century. Starting with the economic philosophy called mercantilism, the international trade theory seeks to respond the basis for and the pattern of international trade between the trading countries and the economic gains of the trading countries from international trade.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

Starting with the economic philosophy called mercantilism, the international trade theory seeks to respond the basis for and the pattern of international trade between the trading countries and the economic gains of the trading countries from international trade. In order to understand the economic gains from international trade, we assume a hypothetical world with two countries, namely Sunland and Lakeland. So as to provide simplicity for the analysis, it is assumed that the countries are producing only two commodities, corn and wheel under increasing opportunity costs.<br/>Autarky is the absence of international trade. At the autarky, production possibilities frontier (PPF) and the consumption possibilities frontier (CPF) of a country are identical. In other words, production and consumption points are the same and they are both on the same frontier. It is impossible to consume at an outer point of the PPF. Nevertheless, international trade enables consumers to consume at a point which is outer than the PPF. It means that the CPF of a country is at an outer level than its PPF with international trade.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

Nevertheless, the essays and writings about economics precede the publication of the distinguished book of Smith. These early writings are mostly on international trade. Thus, international trade is presumed as the precursor of economics.<br/>The essays and writings which precede the Smith’s theory of absolute advantage are mostly the views and explanations of the merchants, government officials, bankers and businessmen. These studies are advocated an economic philosophy, called mercantilism.<br/>Mercantilists argue that the way for a country to become powerful and rich is to export more but import less. Such a policy entails a protectionist trade policy.<br/>Mercantilism acknowledged international trade as a zero-sum game. It means that with international trade a country can gain in the expense of its trade partner.<br/>According to Adam Smith, mutually beneficial trade can take place with absolute advantage. In this respect, the earliest international trade theory that proves a mutually beneficial trade is the theory of Adam Smith, namely the theory of absolute advantage. The theory of absolute advantage postulates that if a country produces only the commodity that it can produce most efficiently and exchanges part of its output for the other commodities it demands, it would maximize its total output and welfare of its individuals.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

Constant returns to scale occur if the percentage increase in output equals the percentage increase in inputs.<br/>Increasing returns to scale occur when the percentage increase in output exceeds the percentage increase in all inputs, with given input prices.<br/>Early trade theories presume that there is perfect competition in the commodity markets. Nevertheless, perfect competition defines the ideal and extreme type of a market structure. In the real world, we often meet imperfect competition in commodity markets. New trade theories extent the analysis through imperfect competitive markets.<br/>Perfect competition is a market in which there are many firms each selling an identical commodity; there are many buyers; there are no restrictions on entry into and exit from the industry; firms in the industry have no advantage over potential new entrants; firms and buyers are well informed about the price of the commodity that each firm is produced."

    "explanation": "Apart from the exchange rate and exchange rate systems, balance of payments is the other main component of the monetary side of international economics. Balance of payments (BOP) of an economy is a summary statement of all the economic transactions made by the foreign currency. Balance of payments displays the economic transactions recorded during a particular period of time which is usually a calendar year.<br/>The main function of the balance of payments is to give information to the government about the international situation of the country. Being informed about the foreign exchange transactions and international situation, the government decides on the implementation of the adequate economic policy. Furthermore, countries which would like to trade with a country might consult to the balance of payments of this prospective trade partner to see its international trade situation. Last but not least, balance of payments data is sufficient to the banks, firms and individuals who would like to make an international transaction. Thus, balance of payments provides information not only to the government but also to the trade partners, banks, firms and individuals of the country.<br/>Balance of payments are recorded depending upon basic principles referred to balance of payments accounting principles. International transactions of an economy are classified as credits and debits. Credit international transactions are those that embrace the receipt of payments from foreigners. Debit international transactions are those that embrace the making of payments to foreigners. Credit international transactions are recorded in the balance of payments with a positive (+) sign while debit international transactions with a negative (-) sign.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the statements in the options related to balance of payment are correct."

We can determine the comparative advantage of Lakeland by comparing the absolute disadvantages in the production of corn and wheel. For Lakeland, the absolute disadvantage in corn production (12:4 = 3) is greater than the absolute disadvantage in wheel production (21:8 =2.625). In other words, the absolute disadvantage is smaller in wheel production for Lakeland, meaning that Lakeland has a comparative advantage in the production of wheel.

In our hypothetical world of two countries and two commodities, the exports of a country are the imports of its trade partner. Thus, the terms of trade of the latter are equal to the inverse or reciprocal, of the terms of trade of the former. If we take our hypothetical world with Sunland and Lakeland as an example, Pc/Pw is the terms of trade of Sunland since it gives the ratio of the price of its export commodity, corn to the price of its import commodity, wheel. On the other hand, Pc/Pw is the terms of trade of Lakeland since it gives the ratio of the price of its export commodity, wheel to the price of its import commodity, corn. In a realistic world of many traded commodities, the terms of trade of a country are given by the ratio of the price index of its exports to the price index of its imports.
