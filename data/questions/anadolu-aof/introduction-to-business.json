    "explanation": "Compensation is the total of all rewards provided employees in return for work and services performed. Internal equity is assured when employees receive pay according to the relative value of their jobs within the same organization. External equity occurs when a firm’s employees receive pay comparable to workers who perform similar jobs in other firms.<br/>The compensation program has three components: base compensation, pay incentives, and benefits.<br/>The basic compensation that an employee receives, usually as a wage or salary, is called base pay. In addition to the basic wage, organizations that are committed to developing a compensation system may prefer to use incentive pay programs. Pay incentives can be defined as compensations that reward employees for their high performance. <br/>Currently, employees expect more than just an hourly wage or salary from their employers; they expect additional considerations that will enrich their lives and support work-life balance. Therefore, many organizations offer benefit programs which are almost 40 percent of the typical total compensation package for employees. A benefit is an indirect reward given to an employee or a group of employees as a part of organizational membership. Training support, discounts for the company’s products, lunch, workplace medical services, and transportation are among benefits that a company provides to its employees.<br/>The correct answer is A."

The success of any HRM program requires the cooperation of managers at different levels who must interpret and implement HRM policies and procedures. Without managerial support, HRM programs cannot succeed. Therefore, human resource managers need to understand clearly how to communicate their policies and procedures to other units of the organisation. There is not only one and the best way for managing human resources. Based on size, sector, employee numbers, financial situation, employee skills and location, each company develops its own HRM program. Organisations operate in a changing environment. Managers need to consistently observe the business environment for opportunities and threats affecting human resources and be prepared to react quickly to these challenges.

Completeness: The information must be enough to allow the decision maker to make the right decision but not so much as to confuse the issue. Today, having excessive information rather than too little is a significant problem for business managers.<br/>3. Timeliness: Managers can reach the information rapidly and on time. E-mail, instant messaging, and other social media tools make it possible for companies to hear about a problem immediately.<br/>4. Relevance: Every decision maker needs a different variety of information. However, the problem is to have too much data by information systems. ecision makers must be careful about the questions they ask to get the answers they need."

The accounting cycle requires summarizing of the entries pertaining to a particular period in a trial balance. A trial balance is essentially a list of all accounts and provides an overview of the various types of financial transactions entered into by any organization during a period. After preparation of trial balance, the next step is recording the adjustments like adjusting prepaid/outstanding expenses, recording advance/accrued income, etc. The purpose of adjusting entries is to match incomes with expense during the accounting period. One of the most important steps of the accounting process involve preparing the financial statements. Final step of the accounting process involves closing the books for the revenue and expense accounts which leads to begin again the entire cycle with zero balances."
