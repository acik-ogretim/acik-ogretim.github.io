    "explanation": "The society of nations justifiably felt threatened and, most would agree, with good cause after the nuclear proliferation, especially of North Korea and Iran.<br/>The worldwide recession of 2008 changed international relations and relevant institutions. Attitudes changed markedly toward the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Sanctions put into place against Russia, Iran, and other states created further unsettling conditions. Migrants into Europe, particularly from Africa’s war-torn states, have placed European states in a difficult position regarding their acceptance of these migrants and the impact they may make on European cultures, societies, and economies. Populism and nationalism also pose their own sets of challenges, with nationalist leaders becoming more belligerent about protecting their sovereign nation-states."

    },
    "explanation": "When the study of International Relations first began in modern times (1930s and forward), it was largely considered a theoretical discipline. The first two foundational volumes were, indeed, theoretically inclined: E.H. Carr’s The Twenty Years’ Crisis (1939) and Hans Morgenthau’s Politics Among Nations (1948). These were formative in the development of the theory of <strong>realism</strong>, as had been the prior works of Thucydides (The Peloponnesian Wars, in the mid-300s BCE), Thomas Hobbes (Leviathan, 1651) and Niccolò Machiavelli (The Prince, 1532)."

    "explanation": "International relations as a distinct field of study began in Britain. International Relations emerged as a formal academic discipline in 1919, just after the end of World War I, with the founding of the first International Relations professorship: the Woodrow Wilson Chair at Aberystwyth, University of Wales (now Aberystwyth University), endowed by David Davies. Georgetown University’s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service is the oldest International Relations faculty in the United States, founded in 1919. In the early 1920s, the famed London School of Economics Department of International Relations was founded at the behest of Nobel Peace Prize winner Philip Noel-Baker: this was the first institute to offer a wide range of degrees in the field. This was rapidly followed by establishment of International Relations at universities in the United States and in Geneva, Switzerland. The creation of the posts of Montague Burton Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics and at Oxford gave further impetus to the academic study of international relations. Furthermore, the International History department at the London School of Economics developed a focus on the history of International Relations in the early modern, colonial and Cold War periods. The first university entirely dedicated to the study of International Relations was the Graduate Institute of International Studies (now the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies), which was founded in 1927 to form diplomats associated to the League of Nations. The Committee on International Relations at the University of Chicago was the first to offer a graduate degree, in 1928. In 1965, Glendon College and the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs were the first institutions in Canada to offer an undergraduate and a graduate program in international studies and affairs, respectively.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is C. The statements in the option I “International relations as a distinct field of study began in Britain and International Relations emerged as a formal academic discipline in 1919 at Aberystwyth, University of Wales (now Aberystwyth University).”, in the option III “In the early 1920s, the famed London School of Economics Department of International Relations, the first institute to offer a wide range of degrees in the field, was founded.”, in the option V “The Committee on International Relations at the University of Chicago was the first to offer a graduate degree, in 1928.” and in the option VI “In 1965, Glendon College and the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs were the first institutions in Canada to offer an undergraduate and a graduate program in international studies and affairs, respectively.” are correct. The statement in the option II “The University of Chicago’s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service is the oldest International Relations faculty in the United States, founded in 1919.” is not correct because of the fact that Georgetown University’s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service is the oldest International Relations faculty in the United States, founded in 1919. The statement in the option VI “The first university entirely dedicated to the study of International Relations was the Graduate Institute of International Studies (now the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies) which was founded in 1928.” is not correct, either. “The first university entirely dedicated to the study of International Relations was the Graduate Institute of International Studies (now the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies) which was founded in 1927.”"

But the range of outcomes has altered, particularly regarding practice and policies.<br/>There are important concepts such as alliances, cooperation, the collective goods problem, the clash of civilizations argument, socialism, terrorism, and the political spectrum. Power remains very important, as is the projection of that power. It has been argued the world is still affected by the former Cold War (1945 - 1999), and that therefore, so have international relations, especially between the United States and Russia, along with the former Soviet states.<br/>Expanded issues in international relations include further development of specific theories, along with the addition of newer ones. International law is now a key element of relations between states and the overall international system. It arose from customary and conventional laws, many of them domestic. Issues of morality and ethics have moved from the philosophical arena to that of political ethics and morality. Humanitarian and humane concerns make up part of this discussion in IR.<br/>International governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations are relative newcomers to International Relations. While the League of Nations was not maintained successfully, the United Nations was founded in 1945, immediately following World War II. The initial purpose of both was to avoid future wars like those that had just been experienced, in which tens of millions died and more millions faced ruined lives and lands. Global devastation from new weapon technology is a genuine concern today, and international organizations attempt to address these threats and others, even those from non-state actors such as paramilitaries, terrorists, nationalist groups, inter-ethnic rivalries and the like. The European Union has grown and expanded from its founding in 1948 to encompass many international issues, with even its own currency, the euro.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is B.

    "explanation": "When the study of International Relations first began in modern times (1930s and forward), it was largely considered a theoretical discipline. The first two foundational volumes were, indeed, theoretically inclined: E.H. Carr’s The Twenty Years’ Crisis (1939) and Hans Morgenthau’s Politics Among Nations (1948). These were formative in the development of the theory of realism, as had been the prior works of Thucydides (The Peloponnesian Wars, in the mid-300s BCE), Thomas Hobbes (Leviathan, 1651) and Niccolò Machiavelli (The Prince, 1532). Realism focuses on how power contributes to a variety of political outcomes and to a state’s security, and by its assumptions, concludes there can be little security for any weak state (one with little power).<br/>Both Carr and Morgenthau argued that the liberal internationalist worldview had been chiefly responsible for the crises of the inter-war years (between World War I and World War II) because that view ignored the ongoing struggle for power. Were a solution to be proposed to this focus of the international system (to ignore power accumulation and the struggles for security), it would be doomed to fail. The realist theories of Carr and Morgenthau also lacked the capacity to predict human behavior, according to those who critiqued them. Noam Chomsky, one of the more radical scholars, noted in 1994 that in international relations, ‘historical conditions are too varied and complex for anything that might be called ‘a theory’ to apply uniformly’ (quoted in Devetak, Burke, and George, 2011, 120).<br/>As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is D. The statements with regard to the theory of realism in the option I “E.H. Carr’s The Twenty Years’ Crisis (1939) and Hans Morgenthau’s Politics Among Nations (1948). were formative in the development of the theory of realism.”, in the option II “Realism focuses on how power contributes to a variety of political outcomes and to a state’s security, and by its assumptions, concludes there can be little security for any weak state (one with little power).”, in the option III “The prior works of Thucydides (The Peloponnesian Wars, in the mid-300s BCE), Thomas Hobbes (Leviathan, 1651) and Niccolò Machiavelli (The Prince, 1532) were also formative in the development of the theory of realism.” and in the option V “The realist theories of Carr and Morgenthau also lacked the capacity to predict human behavior, according to those who critiqued them.” are correct. The statement in the option IV “Both Machiavelli and Hobbes argued that the liberal internationalist worldview had been chiefly responsible for the crises of the inter-war years (between World War I and World War II) because that view ignored the ongoing struggle for power.” is not correct because of the fact that both Carr and Morgenthau, not Machiavelli and Hobbes argued that the liberal internationalist worldview had been chiefly responsible for the crises of the inter-war years (between World War I and World War II) because that view ignored the ongoing struggle for power."

In other words, the more assumptions you must make, the more unlikely an explanation is. If one strips away all extraneous issues, what remains is likely true --no matter how implausible that may seem. One of the more famous fictional characters to apply Occam’s razor to solving his cases was Sherlock Holmes, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br/>The explanations for the other terms in the options are as follows:<br/>Analyzing the characteristics of individual leaders is another approach to individual-level analysis. This is idiosyncratic analysis: how did an individual’s personal traits influence or shape his or her decisions?<br/>Interdependence began to be examined in earnest in the early 1970s. To many theorists of interdependence, the crude power politics of the cold war years appeared to be giving way to a more cooperative and rule-governed world. It is important to understand that the theorists of interdependence were not just talking about increased interconnectedness in a variety of issue areas. The shift was also qualitative. The world was changing. The realist view that states were independently pursuing their national interests did not seem to present an accurate picture of the way states acted under conditions of what Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye called “complex interdependence” (Griffiths and O’Callaghan, 2002, 157-158).<br/>Groupthink: a term coined by social psychologist Irving Janis (1972). It occurs when a group makes faulty decisions because group pressures lead to a deterioration of “mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment.” Groups affected by groupthink ignore alternatives and tend to take irrational actions that dehumanize other groups. A group is especially vulnerable to groupthink when its members are similar in background, when the group is insulated from outside opinions, and when there are no clear rules for decision making (Janis, 1972, 9)."

    "explanation": "Some International Relations scholars suggest four levels of analysis: the individual level, the domestic level (the state), then the interstate level, and following that, the global level (Goldstein and Pevehouse, 2013, 16). Here we will consider the three major analytical levels.<br/><ol> <li>The first level (the individual) attempts to highlight and understand how persons and their characteristics (alone or in groups) impact policy (part of the decision-making process). Individual level analysis is further broken down into factors that affect policy: cognitive, emotional, and psychological ones. Biological factors may also matter. Gender is another biopolitical facet. Finally, individual and group perceptions are very important. If a person is part of a group, other influences can come into play, such as “groupthink” and roles. Analyzing the characteristics of individual leaders is another approach to individual-level analysis. This is idiosyncratic analysis: how did an individual’s personal traits influence or shape his or her decisions? This can be very important because an individual’s characteristics “are crucial to the intentions, capabilities and strategies of a state” (Byman and Pollack, 2001, 111, in Rourke, 2008, 73-74). Many other politically relevant concepts enter into idiosyncratic individual analyses: personality, physical and mental health, ego and ambition, one’s political history and personal experiences, perceptions, and operational reality (this includes leaders’ worldviews). Leaders have formal and informal powers, and each has his or her own leadership capabilities -- a group of characteristics relevant to a chief executive’s authority (Rourke, 2008, 76 and 82).</li> <li>Analysis at the state level explores how the structure and operations of a government affect decisions and policies. The type of government matters (the continuum from liberal democracy to authoritarian state), as does the kind of situations the state faces (crisis versus non-crisis), the kinds of policies under consideration, and the impact the policies could have domestically and on interstate or international relations. How the bureaucracies (career political personnel and their offices) function can be significant. One cannot ignore the influences of interest groups and legislatures, either. How interested the public is in international affairs can make a difference, too, along with how public opinion is aligned to policies. It is important to remember, especially in relation to a state’s foreign policy, that it often reflects its political culture. Henry Kissinger explained American political culture in the following words: “Washington is like a Roman arena [in which] gladiators do battle” (Kissinger, 1982, 421). Other political cultures may be quite different, Asian state cultures, for example.</li> <li>The last level of analysis, the system-level, is focused on the external conditions and pressures that shape a country’s practices and policies (Rourke, 2008, 65). There are specific structural characteristics that are included in system-level analysis: what is the organization of authority? Is the international system anarchical or hierarchical? Further: Is it:</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Unipolar (with only one state as most powerful),</li> <li>bipolar (two great powers), or</li> <li>multipolar? Additionally, is there a hegemon? Are there international organizations to which some states belong? Are there wars or conflicts going on?</li> </ul> As also understood from the information given, all of the statements in the options with regard to the levels of analysis in International Relations are correct, so the correct answer is E."

      "E": "II, IV and V"
    },
    "explanation": "Cooperation: Three basic principles address potential solutions to uncooperative relations among countries: (1) dominance; (2) reciprocity; and (3) identity, according to Goldstein and Pevehouse. In dominance, there is a hierarchy, with those at the top of the hierarchy controlling those below them. This is related to an understanding of “great powers” among states. But it can lead to resentment of those not at the pinnacle. If those at the peak of this arrangement do not act in everyone’s best interests, oppression of those lower on the ladder might follow. Reciprocity, on the other hand, addresses the collective goods challenge by rewarding actions that contribute to the group good, and by punishing those behaviors that are simply self-interested. No central authority is needed, but it can demand very complicated accounting methods and monitoring to track positive contributions and negative actions. Reciprocity is relevant to international relations because it forms the backbone of most norms and many international organizations. Reciprocity can have a negative side, too: in the arms race or security dilemma, each state responds to an increase in military materiel and weapons by others. Identity is very complex in today’s world, particularly because shared identities may well ignore state borders and therefore be transnational. Essentially, this principle means that states redefine their interests and make sacrifice for the group possible. Identity groups will accept collective goods solutions that may not give them the best outcome as individuals, because what benefits there are remain in the family.<br/>As also understood from the information given, three basic principles which address potential solutions to uncooperative relations among countries are dominance, reciprocity and identity, so the correct answer is A. The definitions for the other terms in the options are as follows:<br/>Coalitions are sometimes thought of as alliances, especially when states come together against a common threat. Coalition means a joining together. Coalitions are always multilateral (with associates from different states).<br/>Alliances: An alliance can be defined as “an agreement between two or more states to work together on mutual security issues. States enter such cooperative security arrangements to protect themselves against a common (or perceived) threat."

    },
    "explanation": "The future of International Relations will undoubtedly include the forces of globalization. As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is E. The statements with regard to the future prospects of International Relations in the options can be summarized by using the concept “Globalization”. Many thinkers foresee the development of ways to avoid conflict entirely - or at the very least, minimize it. Some theorists predict that wealth will be redistributed worldwide so that there will be more equity; the international system will not be comprised of “haves” and “have-nots.” Others hope for a decrease in nationalism and an upswing in “cosmopolitanism”, the sense that one is a citizen of the world rather than of a narrower group or affiliation. Some have suggested that cultural diversity will become more tolerated and more understood by greater proportions of the global population, and that this will render some of today’s International Relations theories null. To others, power and selfinterest will no longer dominate international relations as it does today, foregoing the terms of realism, and more liberal and perhaps even idealistic theories will be able to explain a different kind of world than we have today. Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” theory may no longer explain international relations and zones of conflict, or even make sense, as boundaries, difference and acceptance adapt to changing global politics. Humanitarianism may well arise as the leading topic; peoples might become as concerned with the well-being of others who share the globe as they currently are of their own strengths. Certainly, climate change, pollution, and non-fossil-fueled power will continue to be valid issues.<br/>The explanations for the other concepts in the options are as follows:<br/>Coalitions are sometimes thought of as alliances, especially when states come together against a common threat. Coalition means a joining together. Coalitions are always multilateral (with associates from different states). Before, during and post-World Wars I and II, alliances formed and then re-formed, depending on how international conditions were interpreted by various states and other entities. Multilateral coalitions are generally favored in modern times, allying several states together to take on a threat to or concern of all involved, either on the state or international level (consider United Nations peacekeeping missions containing troops from several or many states).<br/>Mutually Assured Destruction: A relationship between two states in which each can destroy the other’s society even after absorbing an all-out attack (or ﬁrst strike) by the other state. In short, each state has an invulnerable second-strike capability (Griffiths and O’Callaghan, 2002, 201).<br/>Human rights are also equal and nondiscriminatory. “Non-discrimination is a cross-cutting principle in international human rights law. The principle is present in all the major human rights treaties and provides the central theme of international human rights conventions such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. <br/>Power Projection: The capability of a country to project (or, alternatively, physically bring via sealift or airlift) its military power to any part of the world rapidly and with little advance notice. The United States is assessed to be especially good at this, as it has the largest inventory of nuclear weapons and the most high-tech weaponry overall. It continues to lead the world in terms of research on products intended for military use."

    "explanation": "The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 constituted the starting point of the international system: Europe adopted a specific kind of sovereignty and regular interactions among mutually-recognized sovereign states emerged. Further, these interactions developed specific patterns of relations in terms of cooperation and conflict through the normative institutionalization of mutual exchanges between states. They have evolved and developed over time as the international system geographically expanded and its numbers of political actors increased. The Peace of Westphalia incorporated the treaties of Münster and Osnabrück that officially ended the Thirty Years’ War in 1648. Some key features of international politics have been ascribed to the content of these treaties, since they symbolized the emergence of a new international order in which sovereign states interact with each other. As can be understood from the information given the correct answer is A.<br/>The information about the treaties which take place in the other options is as follows:<br/>In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg was signed to reduce sectarian tensions in Europe. It sought peaceful coexistence between Roman Catholics and Protestants (at that time limited to Lutherans) and gave every prince within the Holy Roman Empire the right to choose either Lutheranism or Roman Catholicism in their own domains. However, in practice the Peace of Augsburg was not able to resolve the dispute either religiously or politically.<br/>Between 1648 and 1789, each succession war was concluded with a peace settlement following an international diplomatic congress that included all the warring parties, The Peace of Utrecht put an end to the Spanish Succession Wars in 1713, for instance.<br/>Imposed top-down by the victorious powers, the restoration of Europe came under threat from modern ideas introduced by the French Revolution, including liberalism and nationalism. For this reason, it was considered essential to set up a structure that would guarantee the maintenance of the Vienna settlement. To do so, the Congress of Vienna made significant arrangements for the restructuring of the international system. The major powers sought to recreate a new European political landscape that would parallel the former system and restore the balance of power."

      "E": "II, III, IV and V"
    },
    "explanation": "The international system has so far been successful in protecting its basic political unit, the sovereign state. Despite inherent conflicts in the international system, the Westphalian principles of state sovereignty, equality, and non-interference have formed a basis for cooperation among states. These principles have led to the uniformity of political units, allowing states to develop and adopt norms and principles for cooperation. International organizations such as the United Nations and international norms such as “the prohibition on the alteration of state borders by force” arise from the political and legal inheritance of Westphalian principles.<br/>Realizing that their armies had only limited power because tax resources proved so meager, European states discovered that cooperation was cheaper and a more effective way to maximize their interests. Thus, the rapid development of a central mechanism for the functioning of the international system: diplomacy.<br/>Between 1648 and 1789, each succession war was concluded with a peace settlement following an international diplomatic congress that included all the warring parties, as noted in Table 2.1. The Peace of Utrecht put an end to the Spanish Succession Wars in 1713, for instance. At these congresses, inter-dynastic kinship also facilitated compromise rather than punishment. Congress diplomacy rarely had a transformative impact on the structure of the international system. Instead, it served to restore the status quo and confirm the international system established by the Peace of Westphalia. Both winners and losers of wars had a role to play in the construction of peace. In this period, the principle of sovereign equality provided both powerful and small states with the opportunity of equal representation within the framework of congress diplomacy. The international system based on the principles of the Peace of Westphalia prevailed and was consolidated.<br/>As understood from the information given the correct answer is D.<br/>On the other hand, The French Revolution constituted a major blow to the existence of the Westphalian system in many respects. First it created an anomaly at the heart of international system. The international system had been composed of states whose political systems were monarchies; the practices and norms of the international system were entirely based on aristocratic traditions and values.<br/>So when France proclaimed itself a republic in 1793, it also undermined the political homogeneity of states within the international system.<br/>Moreover the new regime in France interrupted inter-dynastic relations that had formed the basis of European diplomacy. European monarchies could not establish a regular relationship with France other than war. Why? Because the bureaucracies of monarchs had no common basis on which to establish relations with a government that did not share their aristocratic values and qualifications. Nor did the French Republic have a diplomatic alternative to war, since it had not been recognized as a legitimate political unit by other states."

New Industrial Technologies and overseas markets paved the way for a global economic transformation. The second development was the political revolotuion in France. During the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century. France became the center for new ideas, especially liberty, citizenship equality, fraternity, and patriotism. Against a background of a severe economic crisis, military reversals, and a series of poor harvests, the French Revolution began in 1789. It first sought to end the absolutist rule of Louis XVI and the vicious feudal system of estates or castes. The French Revolution had far-reaching consequences. As understood from the information given the correct answer is A. The other hand, the Peace of Westphalia incorporated the treaties of Münster and Osnabrück that officially ended the Thirty Years’ War in 1648.

This treaty recognized all national borders in Europe and outlawed the use of force to change these borders. The Act stated that “the participating states regard as inviolable all one another’s frontiers as well as the frontiers of all states in Europe and therefore they will refrain now and in the future from assaulting these frontiers. Accordingly, they will also refrain from any demand for, or act of, seizure and usurpation of part or all of the territory of any participating state”. As also understood from the information given the correct answer is A.<br/>The information about the treaties taking place in the other options are as follows:<br/>The de-escalation of the Cold War in Europe also affected the relationship between the bloc leaders. The United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics began negotiations to decrease their nuclear arsenals. The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks bore fruit when the first Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty was signed in 1972. In 1979 both parties found common ground to sign a section treaty, although the United States withdrew from the treaty in 1980, thus blocking any further cooperation between the two superpowers<br/>A third bloc of states appeared in the mid-1950s that wanted to distance itself both ideological camps. This was the so-called Non-Aligned Movement, a collective movement of states that had only recently gained their independence from Western imperial powers.<br/>The United States organized The Hague Conference of 1907 to determine a set of common values and diplomatic practices. One significant decision taken at that conference called for the creation of a permanent international organization within seven years, one where states would be equally represented and where they could resolve their disputes through negotiations.<br/>In January 1919, the Paris Peace Conference convened to negotiate peace agreements that would shape the new international system."

Idealism bases elements of its theory on politics as a non-zero-sum game; states can benefit by cooperating with other states, and by tolerating difference. Mutual gains, especially economic and security gains, then become more meaningful and significant than entering conflicts with other states. <br/>A Self-Help System: There are two basic principles underlying neorealism: first, the international system’s ordering principle is anarchy: there is no such thing as a world power superior to states. This results in an international system that is essentially a self-help system, with autonomous states that are functionally similar actors, each of which must always be prepared to defend or protect itself."

    "explanation": "The mission of NATO had been to improve transatlantic relations by tying the United States to Europe to deter the Soviet/ Russian aggression and to secure European security through taming German power. However, in response to West Germany’s joining NATO in 1955, the Soviet Union created its own alliance (with Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania), which was called the Warsaw Pact. These two alliances, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, thus created a balance and deterrence for countries in one group from attacking countries in the rival alliance. The two alliances carried the world through the Cold War and proved to prevent escalating aggression. However, given the restructuring of many of these countries over the years, the Warsaw Pact became ineffective. In 1990, East Germany left the Warsaw Pact to reunite with West Germany, forming a unified Germany. Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland all withdrew. In 1991, Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev resigned, thereby finally eroding the Warsaw Pact (Office of the Historian)."

While Germany has agreed to take refugees, it is experiencing internal opposition by some who seek to stop the entrance of Syrians. The newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump has made two attempts at travel bans, in part to stop to the influx of Syrian refugees. His claim is that there is a matter of national security relating to the welcoming of refugees. Raven (2015) notes that racism, fear of ISIS and a country’s respective internal conflicts lie at the root of the many countries denying or minimizing access.<br/>By contrast to the American approach, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada has made a commitment to resettling Syrian refugees. Canada is offering a website and list of Canadian communities willing to accept Syrian refugees escaping their war-torn country (Global Affairs Canada, 2016). Though President Trump of the United States has claimed that cancelling visas from seven Muslim countries would help secure the American homeland, his opponents have argued that his policy emboldens terrorist claims that the western states are anti-Muslim.

To convey such a threat, the deterrer must decide what constitutes an attack, and must then decide what level of response would be adequate to deter it.

The nature of war has changed. While states do still invade each other, another form of war has been on the rise over the last twenty years. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was a centralized act of aggression that led to the Gulf War."

    "explanation": "Despite the policies of the United Nations, the conversation continues to consider what exactly is meant by the relevant words, especially “force”. Article 2 Paragraph 4 uses terms like “the threat or use of force,” but not “war.” However, force can include psychological force, economic force, military force, or political force. In 1970, this issue was addressed with the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations: No State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all against its political, economic and cultural elements are in violation of international law (Rauschning, 1997: 5). Therefore, for example, interfering in elections and governments is construed as a violation of international law."

    "explanation": "Because some issues are regulated by both international law and municipal laws, and since the main actor in both legal systems is the state, there is naturally a relationship between the two legal systems. There are, however, two aspects or problems to be dealt with.<br/><ul> <li>First, when rules of the two systems on the same issue conflict, this must be settled.</li> <li>Second, as there are common issues and actors, can rules of one legal system, thet is those of international law, be directly applied in the relam of the other system?</li> </ul> There are two different ways to answer these questions.<br/>First is the Dualist View. This stipulates that international law and municipal laws are two separate legal systems so that there cannot be a conflict of rules. What about the application of the rules of one to the other? This perspective stipulates that to apply the rules in the other realm, a given rule must be transferred into the relam of the other legal system. On the other hand, the Monist View differs. It stipulates that international law and municipal law are parts of the same legal system, because there is only one legal realm in the world. In the case of a conflict of rules, some argue that international law is superior over the municipal rules, but others differ. Both views are grounded in reason.<br/>As to the issue of transfer of rules, the Monist View stipulates that there is no need to transfer the rules from one to the other, simply because they are parts of the same legal system. Thus, both can be applied directly. As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is D, in other words the first, the fourth and the fifth options reflect the Monis View. The second and the third options, by contrast reflect the Dualist perspective. The Dualist View stipulates that international law and municipal laws are two separate legal systems so that there cannot be a conflict of rules. This perspective also stipulates that to apply the rules in the other realm, a given rule must be transferred into the relam of the other legal system."

The bulk of these benefits<br/>would be best maintained and delivered by this new cooperative arrangement.<br/>Functionalism and neofunctionalism differ from one another in several respects, however:<br/>• Neofunctionalism is a theory of regional, not global, integration. “Concentrating<br/>on a region in this way neo-functionalists have been able to achieve great parsimony of concepts and theories” (Evans and Newnham, 1998, 359).<br/>• Functionalists were not much concerned with institution-building, but<br/>neofunctionalists are.<br/>• Neofunctionalists are attuned to the political implications and complications of strong integration because of a “spillover effect”: it would then include other related areas of action. Spillover integration would be very difficult to resist because of high levels of interdependency. Influential interest groups<br/>within regional member-states would also begin to increase pressures to begin further integration."

      "A": "Formation of an economic community",

    "explanation": "Some scholars suggest that such a shift in sovereignty would more likely be some form of federalism, where “states and political units recognize the sovereignty of a central government while retaining certain powers for themselves. This is the form of government adopted in the U.S. Constitution” (Goldstein and Pevehouse, 2013, 227). Still, integration, such as that seen in the<br/>Western European states, with their supranational institutions and the formation of an economic community, largely free trade promotion and coordinated economic policies and programs, seemed to defy the realist presumption that states would never voluntarily yield power or sovereignty, and would remain autonomous entities. But there has been push-back against this greater level of integration. Nations and peoples, along with local groups, may want more, not<br/>less, say in their own affairs. Cultures may feel threatened with the centralization of political authority, information and privileges-they might<br/>not wish for homogeneous or melting pot effects. Nationalism has been on the rise over the past decade throughout Europe and elsewhere. Some of this nationalism has led to dis-integration such as that which occurred after the fall of the Soviet Union, especially in the former Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union itself (leaving, technically, Russia as the remaining entity from the original Union<br/>of Soviet Socialist Republics) There is, without question, a tension between integration, no matter at what level, and nationalism."

    },
    "explanation": "The European Union is unique for several reasons: one of the most significant reasons is that “democracy in the EU comes from the member states<br/>rather than the Union itself (Rumford, 2002, 215). Hence, the European Union should be understood as a unique political system because it (1) “governs<br/>without government” but also because (2) it has a democratic tradition running through many of its member states. Democracy is fundamental to the applicant countries and is championed as a part of European identity (Rumford, 2002, 209-210). The European Union is also different from other regional organizations in that in some issue areas, such as trade and the economy, it has a supranational character. Put differently, decisions taken at the union’s headquarters in Brussels in these issue areas are binding for all member<br/>states. However, in some issue areas -- security and defense, notably -- the European Union does not have any supranational power but acts as a<br/>regional organization. In other words, currently the European Union is not a federal institution."

An African Union president is chosen to serve, usually for a term of one year from January to January of the following year. many respects, especially on such a large and varied continent with so many ethnic, tribal, and other relationships that transcend national borders, the African Union has concentrated on security oriented projects, knowing firsthand how unsettled the continent has been historically. It has been able to mount specific military-peacekeeping missions in Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Mali, the Central African Republic and elsewhere, sometimes in joint efforts<br/>with United Nations deployments."

States participate in the regionalization efforts voluntarily to manage the challenges of global transformations. Regionalism is one of those few instruments that are available to states as they work to cope with the challenges of globalization. In this context, for states, regionalism can also become a means to regain some control over the globalization process. One, therefore, can conclude that new regionalism and the rise of regions can be considered not only a result of, but also a reaction to, globalization.
