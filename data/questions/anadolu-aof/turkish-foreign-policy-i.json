    "explanation": "World War II constituted an important watershed for Turkey’s foreign and security policies as well as its domestic political and economic development. Although the modernization process had started in the 1930s before the war, it was still an unfinished business when the war broke out. Similarly, economic reforms were still in progress in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Substantial social transformation had been achieved under Mustafa Kemal’s guidance; however, some critical political reforms were still waiting to be instituted. There was also a distinct reluctance in terms of economic and political dependency on the West, though the relations with the West as well as with the East were considerably expanded. All these needed to be re-examined after the war and the renewed reform process needed to realign Turkey with international developments. However, the resulting attempt at accelerating the modernization process (which meant Westernization at the time) quickly turned into a dependency relationship with the Western powers as the interwar years’ multipolar international system transformed into a bipolar one. Thus, both systemic factors<br/>and domestic developments pushed Turkey toward a Western-dependent stance in international relations and accompanying Western-leaning foreign policy."

The restoration of Turkish sovereignty over the straits helped Turkey regain its historical role as the armed guardian of the straits. Second, the renewal of Turkish authority in the straits granted Turkey a liberty to close the straits to foreign warships during a war.

Hence, it never signed the Lausanne Treaty that consolidated Turkey’s sovereignty at the end of the conference.

    "explanation": "Turkey applied to the League to reclaim its sovereignty over the straits in 1936. Turkish government made its case with reference to the principle of rebus sic stantibus that means obligations of treaty are terminable in the case of a fundamental change of circumstances. Turkey claimed that the circumstances of the Lausanne Treaty were altered so much that the provisions of the Lausanne Treaty concerning the status of the straits were no longer applicable. Turkey put forward several key issues that compromised the League’s capability to protect the Straits against a potential aggression. First, the aggressive policies of revisionist powers including Germany and Italy along with the general process of rearmament across Europe resulted in an intensive ‘feeling of general insecurity’ (E 2024/26/44). Second, Italy changed the balance of power in the Mediterranean by remilitarizing the Dodecanese islands. Turkish decision-makers considered this act as a direct threat against Anatolia. Moreover, international system became more insecure especially after Italy and Japan rejected to be bound by international norms and treaties. Finally, Turkey argued that the unilateralism of Germany, Italy and Japan encouraged unilateral actions and repudiation of international agreements in other parts of the world. Overall, Turkey argued with reference to the principle of rebus sic stantibus that the secure environment at the time of the Lausanne Treaty disappeared and Europe became considerably insecure. Therefore, Turkish government claimed that the straits committee under the League of Nations had no longer the capability to maintain the straits’ security, and asked for the revision of their legal status."

    "explanation": "The Mosul problem could be seen as the only major issue for Turkish foreign policy during the rest of 1920s. After Lausanne, the Republic of Turkey was established on 29 October 1923. Turkey thereafter initiated a pro-Western transformation process by adopting the European legal system, reforming its education system based on the West-inspired scientific methods, embracing a European style dress code and adopting Latin alphabet. During this transformation period, Turkey rather took a low profile in its foreign policy mainly remaining loyal to its status quoism. Therefore, we do not observe much foreign policy developments on Turkey’s part. The only notable exception was Mosul, which was left unsolved in Lausanne. Mosul was still an Ottoman territory when the Mudros armistice was signed; however, from 3 November 1918 onwards the British troops started to occupy the region. Mosul was important for Turkey in terms of security of both Turkey and the Turkoman subjects living in Mosul. There was also the issue of oil resources. For Turkey, the loss of Mosul meant the abandonment of the National Pact (Hale, 2000: 50). For Britain, it was strategically crucial as it constituted a passage to the British dominions in India. Moreover, the oil resources of Mosul were the only source of income for Iraq to stand on its feet."

Accordingly, Turkey had no intention to involve itself in the domestic problems of Muslim countries. The new Turkish state aimed to create a modernized and Westernized society based on a secular worldview. It chose to disregard the Ottoman heritage in its relations with Muslim states. In the Cold War period, Turkey’s relationship with Middle Eastern countries was shaped by its alliance with the West and its fear of communist expansion in the region.

While Greece and Turkey joined the Western alliances, Yugoslavia and Albania remained non-aligned, and Romania and Bulgaria became the Soviet Union’s satellite states. As a result, ethnic and religious issues, with a high potential for conflict, were frozen in time. In this sense, “the bipolar world system brought peace to the Balkans” (Turan and Barlas, 1999). This, though, enabled Turkey to follow policies encouraging stability and cooperation in the region. A second Balkan Pact (after the one established in 1934) was created in 1954 between Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Greece.

    "explanation": "In 1959, the Menderes-led Democrat Party government signed an agreement that allowed the US administration to install Jupiter missiles in Turkey with medium-range nuclear warheads. These missiles became outdated even before their installation, but the Turkish government considered this an opportunity to display the strength of its alliance with the US. Under the mounting Soviet protests, however, the US administration canceled the installation and met with the Turkish refusal to withdraw from the agreement. The Turkish government emphasized the importance of the missiles for Turkey’s security, at least until they were replaced with Polaris submarines. It is argued that Khrushchev’s decision to install the Soviet missiles in Cuba was the retribution for the US-Turkish missile cooperation. Consequently, in 1962, the Cuban missile crisis erupted, and the Jupiter missiles in Turkey became a bargaining chip for the Soviets. The reciprocal removal of the Jupiter missiles from Turkey and the Soviet missiles from Cuba was proposed by the Soviets. Although the US administration refused to confirm such a deal, the Kennedy administration unilaterally removed the Jupiter missiles from Turkey in 1963."

    "explanation": "Some domestic and external factors pushed Turkey to follow a pro-American foreign policy and to be cautious toward the Soviets in this era. In 1979, the Islamic Revolution ousted the pro-American Shah regime in Iran, and the Soviet Union militarily intervened in Afghanistan to support the Communist government of Afghanistan in its fight with the Islamist Mujahedeen. Statements from the fundamentalist Iranian government about the export of their Islamic regime throughout the region created concerns for Turkey about a possible spillover into its own territory. Domestically, the mounting economic and social problems, along with the political instability resulted in a coup d’état on September 12, 1980. Consequently, Turkey remained under a military regime until 1983. Unlike the 1960 coup d’état, the 1980 military intervention banned all political activities and prevented any development toward a civil society. The military intervention in Turkey drew the most severe criticism from the European countries. It is claimed that “the crucial factor in this connection has been Turkey’s receptivity towards external, i.e. European, pressures due to the existence of its political, economic, military and ideological links with Europe."
