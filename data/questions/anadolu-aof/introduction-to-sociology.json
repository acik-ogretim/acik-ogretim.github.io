Very low levels of social integration are related to egoistic suicide. <strong>Egoistic suicide</strong> occurs when family, work and community ties weaken, people can not bound to social groups and find little social guidance about values, norms, traditions and goals. Because of the lack of social integration, they feel that they do not belong to the society. When bonds weaken due to loss of family, loss of friends, or a retirement, probability of egoistic suicide increases. Therefore, the correct option is B."

      "E": "Industrial societies"
    },
    "explanation": "In the most general level, societies before the 18th century are called “traditional societies”. In the Western world, the majority of the traditional societies transformed through Enlightenment, Scientific and Political Revolutions and the Industrial Revolution, and a new society emerged. This new type of society is called “the industrial society” or “the modern society”. In specific, the traditional societies are categories as <em>hunting and gathering societies, pastoral societies, agrarian societies</em> and <em>traditional states</em>. The earliest type of societies is hunting and gathering societies, which exist since 50,000 BC to present. However, today there are only a few <em>hunting and gathering societies</em> in the world. This type of society consists of small numbers of people, such as 30-40 people. People are nomad and gain their livelihood from hunting, fishing, and gathering edible plants. <em>Pastoral societies are the societies </em>in which the gain of livelihood is based on domesticated livestock such as cattle or sheep. These societies generally live in areas which are not suitable for agriculture. These societies consist of a larger population than hunting and gathering societies. Their population varies from a few hundred people to many thousand people. <em>Agrarian societies</em> are the societies of small rural communities which are engaged in agriculture. They often hunt animals and gather edible plants in addition to agricultural production. Their existence period is approximately same with pastoral societies. The societies known as <em>traditional states</em> or non-industrial civilizations existed between 6000 BC to 19th century. The correct answer is Choice A."

    "explanation": "Social institution refers to arrangements involving large numbers of people whose behaviors are guided by norms and roles. A <em>social institution</em> is a socially organized social behavior pattern that reflects the established appearance of the society, which are continuously repeated, maintained and approved by the social norms. Neither the society nor the members of the society obtain themselves incidentally. Most of our activities are structured, regular, continuous and repetitive. <em>Social structure</em> is composed of these social actions of and the interactions among the members of the society. In social life, there are phenomena different than physical sciences examine. These phenomena are known as <em>social facts</em> or <em>social reality</em>. <em>Social facts</em> are created collectively by society. They are exterior, inevitable and limiting for the individuals. A <em>status </em>is the rank, the position that one holds in the society. Anybody may occupy the status of a son or a daughter, a husband or a wife, a teacher, or a mother. Statuses are divided into two basic types. These are ascribed and achieved status. Society expects specific behaviors from people who hold specific statuses and these expected behaviors are called “roles”. <em>Roles </em>are composed of the rights and assignments appropriate to the social status.

All of these disciplines examine human behavior, they are all interested in the human- built social World. Philosophy and sociology have a close relation. The rise of sociology is mostly the result of a philosophical desire, the desire to give meaning to human history, to explain the social crisis in the 19th century and to create a social doctrine that will guide to social politics. The relation between philosophy and sociology has three main dimensions. First, sociology makes use of philosophy of science, as it is a science itself. Second, sociology is interested in values while studying social facts, so it has to know the debates of values in ethics and social philosophy. Third, sociology helps new philosophical questions to arise. The correct answer is Choice B."

    },
    "explanation": "The sciences, in the most general sense, are divided into two; the mathematic sciences and positive sciences. Mathematical sciences are divided into mathematic and logic. Positive sciences are divided into physical sciences and social sciences. Mathematic is an observable and objective science, because the starting point of mathematical concepts is observation, and the entities they symbolize are objective realities, even though they are abstract. The other branch of mathematic sciences is logic. Logic is a science that shows the conditions of validity and correctness of deductions, and like mathematics, logic is also tautological. Mathematics provides precision and logic provides consistency to our knowledge. Thus, mathematical sciences are tools that other sciences use for quantification, knowledge derivation and deducting. Positive sciences are innovative sciences, they have observable, empirical study subjects and make deductions on these subjects. Positive sciences split up to physical sciences and social sciences. Physical sciences are the sciences which study animated and unanimated substances and material facts. Some of the physical sciences are astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology and zoology. Social sciences are the sciences which study social world and the relations among people. Sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics and political science are some of the social sciences.

      "A": "Providing all conditions of the circumstance to be the same, experiments enable scientists to make explicit predictions.",
      "B": "Scientists cannot influence the reaction of their subjects.",
      "C": "Scientists may investigate facts singly and examine the causality relationship between them.",
      "D": "Measurement is much easier in social sciences compared with physical sciences.",
      "E": "Scientists prefer to investigate people in their natural environments rather than in a laboratory environment."
    },
    "explanation": "There are some important differences between physical and social sciences: (1) Physical scientists may conduct experiments in order to test and prove hypotheses. In social sciences, the study subjects are human beings and they have the right not to join the test. In addition, creating an environment of a laboratory may hinder people from behaving naturally, thus may be an obstacle to reaching the actual facts. For this reason, social scientists prefer to investigate people in their natural environments rather than in a laboratory environment. (2) In physical sciences, providing that all conditions of the circumstance will be the same, experiments enable scientists to make explicit predictions. However, it is impossible to make predictions with this much certainty in social sciences. The interaction of individuals, groups and society are complex and people may change their minds with their own will, for this reason making estimations in social sciences is not this easy. People may react and behave differently in the same circumstances, they may interpret the same fact differently, or may change their minds. Consequently, the regularities or laws in the social world cannot be put forward with the same certainty degree as in physical sciences. (3) In physical sciences, scientists cannot influence the reaction of their subjects. However, social scientists are members of the society they investigate, they may influence the people they investigate and may be influenced by them. Thus, it is harder to be objective in social sciences than it is in physical sciences. In addition to this, unlike social sciences, physical scientists do not have to persuade the study subjects to cooperate in research. In social sciences, the subjects have free will, the scientists have to persuade the people they investigate to cooperate. People may prefer not to cooperate in research, refuse to answer the questions, or they may give incorrect or deficit information, or may lie intentionally. This kind of behavior would make a sociological research impossible, difficult or unreliable. (4) In physical sciences scientists may investigate facts singly and examine the causality relationship between them. On the contrary, because the structure of the society is complex and there are many factors influencing the causality relations, social scientists have to take the social world as a whole. (5) Measurement is much easier in physical sciences. The subjects of physical sciences are often in measurable conditions, they may be expressed by measures such as weight, length, density or volume. Because there are not standard measures for measuring behaviors, perceptions or attitudes of people, it is harder to make measurements in social sciences. The correct answer is Choice E."

    },
    "explanation": "The approach which depends on the thoughts of Wilhelm Dilthey and Max Weber is Interpretive Approach. Critical approach depends on the thoughts of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. When the structure of social reality is examined, it will be seen that Critical Approach supports the idea that social realities are the conflicts which are created by the underlying mechanisms of the surface. They cannot be seen at first glance by individuals. On the other hand, the approach which supports the idea that social realities are the regularities which exist independent of individual subjectivity and which wait to be discovered is the Positivist Approach. In Critical Approach, the aim of the social research is to criticize and transform social relations and to change the World not to understand and define social action and to put forward how people make sense of social facts in their natural environments. It is the aim of the social research in Interpretive Approach. In Critical Approach, a good finding displays the illusions and uncovers social realities. In terms of human nature, Critical Approach supports the idea that people are creative entities with potential, who are trapped by illusions and exploitation not the idea that people do not act with their own will, they act rationally and their behaviors are shaped by exterior forces.

Interview forms are not used in unstructured interviews; the interviews are conducted in a conversation environment. In <em>life story interview</em> the researcher interviews people who reflect the research problem. The interview includes the entire life course in details. The researcher tries to understand the social fact s/he studies through the life experiences of the participants. <em>Oral history</em> is similar to the life story interview. However, in oral history, not the entire life is subject to the interview. The interview includes only a part, a historical period of the life of the participant. The <em>case study</em> is the examination of a social fact in its own social context, through a variety of data gathering techniques. In case study, only a single critical case is examined rather than a larger sample of the population, and the researcher focuses only on this case rather than more general indicators of the research problem. Thus, the researcher may make longer and more detailed observations. The “case” in the case study may be an event, an institution, a group or a person. For example, the case may be a specific hospital, a specific strike, or a person who had an occupational injury. <em>The analysis of documents</em> like books, newspapers, magazines, reports, records, correspondences, proceedings, diaries, memoirs or letters are called document analysis or documentary analysis.

Merton.<br/><strong>Functionalism deals with society as a system consisting of interrelated pieces.</strong> At this point, we should remember that Durkheim also explained society through its similarities to a biological entity. Functionalism in modern sociology deals with society as a system based on self-regulation, which implies that society has a natural intuition to protect itself and have a balance.

Therefore, there is always a change in the society. On the other hand, since functionalist sociologists deal with society as a functional unity, they are mainly interested in order, balance, harmony, stability and collaboration. Critical theorists have argued that the problem of modernity is not just the injustices and inequalities of the capitalist system, but that all modern societies are organized by instrumental rationality. On the other hand, Parsons argues in his structural-functional approach that social order stems from value consensus rather than obligation. Parsons states that what prevents society from collapsing is <em>order</em>, i.e how a system operates and there are certain functional obligations that needs to be fulfilled to ensure the operation of the system and each system has its sub-systems that fulfill these functions.

Postmodernism has led to intellectual transformation in sociology and in the western thought as a whole. Giddens<br/>(2009: 98) argues that postmodernism has recently lost its importance, especially in the face of globalization theories, and that globalization<br/>theories are more explanatory in understanding the direction of social change in today’s 21st century societies."

Considering the latest minimum wage for 2022 was determined to be 4253 Turkish Lira per month, which fundamental concept of poverty accurately describes the status of minimum wage workers in Turkey in 2022 if <strong>both</strong> parents were employed in minimum wage jobs?",
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "options": {
      "A": "Absolute poverty.",
      "B": "Relative poverty.",
      "C": "Social exclusion.",
      "D": "Wage inequality.",
      "E": "Human inequality."
    },
    "explanation": "Absolute poverty is an individual’s or a family’s lack of income and consumption by failing to meet the basic biological needs like food, shelter and clothing. Absolute poverty is also expressed as livelihood poverty because it is evaluated on the requirements for minimum living necessities. Absolute poverty measurements generally delimit the poverty with financial poverty (Harlambos and Holborn, 1995, p.125). The data gathered in the research for the question above indicates a 10,395.91 Turkish Lira per month income for these basic necessities, while the minimum wage of <strong>two</strong> working adults would only provide 8506 Turkish Lira per month.<br/>Relative poverty is an individual’s, a family’s, or a social group’s deprivation of the necessary resources to get nourishment adequately, participate in social and cultural activities (at least the common and usual ones), and live a standard life of the societies they live in. Relative poverty involves the consideration of social needs besides the basic physical needs. Additionally, an average living standard of the society is considered differently from absolute poverty (Harlambos and Holborn, 1995, p.125). Considering the fact that nutrition, shelter (housing), and clothes are considered minimum living necessities to fulfill basic biological needs, the example above does not refer to any standard of living beyond these absolute basic requirements. Therefore the correct answer is absolute poverty."

Pluralist approach claims to explain the power and distribution of power in Western democratic societies. There are two versions of pluralism which are classical pluralism and elite pluralist approach. Classical pluralist approach has similarities with Talcott Parsons’ functionalist perspective. Pluralists agree with Parsons that power ultimately derives from the population as a whole."

Marxist perspective claims there are different interests between who hold the power (means of production) and who do not, and this differentiation in interests leads to a conflict in the society. For Marx, power is concentrated in the hands of those who have the economic control within a society. “From this perspective, the source of power lies in the economic infrastructure.<br/>Marxist-conflict"

Differentiation, rationalization and commodification are superseded by hyperdifferentiation, hypercommodification and hyper-rationalization...This leads to a new type of culture: Crook et al. call this new culture postculture.<br/>Hypercommodification: Hypercommodification involves all areas of social life becoming commodified... Consumption increasingly takes place within the home, and members of the same family become inclined to consume different things... Instead of a uniform family culture, each family member chooses their own lifestyle.<br/>Hyper-rationalization: Hyper-rationalization involves the use of rationalized technology to spread cultural consumption more widely and to privatize it. Technology such as the satellite TV allows greater individuals choice about what do watch... Again, this allows individuals to choose their own lifestyle... Media images come to dominate society. Media copies and reproductions begin to replace the authentic, real thing they present. Eventually, images and signs lose their connections with reality and become what Baudrillard calls simulacra.<br/>Hyperdifferentiation: Crook et al., argue: ‘In postmodernization a thousand flowers bloom.’ A fantastic variety of cultural forms develop with no particular type being dominant... The increased fragmentation of culture -hyperdifferentation- leads ultimately to dedifferentiation, in which distinction between different types of culture break down. In particular, the distinction between high culture and popular culture is undermined in postmodernizing societies."

    "explanation": "Modern Culture<br/>According to Crook et al., there are three main characteristics of modern culture: differentiation, rationalization and commodification.<br/>Differentiation: Differentiation involves the separating out of different parts of society. Economic, political, social and cultural spheres become increasingly distinct from one another... Culture was therefore separated or differentiated from other aspects of life. It was produced by specialists, trained in particular institutions, and it was consumed in specific places...<br/>Rationalization: According to Crook et al., rationalization also shaped modern culture, but not as completely as differentiation...Technology was used to make it possible to recreate or copy culture... Radios and record players allowed broadcasts and copies of original music to be consumed widely... Nevertheless, in modernity the rationalization of culture can only proceed so far, since the individual creativity of the great artist is still valued.<br/>Commodification: The commodification of culture involves turning cultural products into commodities that can be readily bought and sold..."

Because of their shorter life, it is hard for nuclear families to transmit a family culture to the children. This process is easier in extended families.<br/></li> <li> In nuclear families, there is minimalcontact with the kin group. However, kin group contact on a daily basis in extended families.

This reduces the offerings of the kinship network to its members. The family in industrial societies cannot provide or guarantee jobs, education or training to its members.

There are similar criticisms directed particularly at Parsons. Parsons has been criticized for idealizing the family and ignoring the conflict between parents and among children. In addition, his analysis of the family largely depends on American middle class family and fails to explain working class or ethnic minority families. Parson’s notion of socialization process also has problems. Parsons regards socialization as a one-way process in which parents transfer their culture to children and shape their personalities.

    },
    "explanation": "As a functionalist, Durkheim believes that religion promotes social cohesion and conformity by imposing meaning and purpose on life. According to Durkheim, religious ritual is an important part of this social cement. Religion, through its rituals, fulfills a number of social functions such as binding people together physically, promoting social cohesion, reaffirming the group’s beliefs and values. Those functions help maintain norms, mores, and prohibitions. Durkheim is generally considered the first sociologist who analyzed religion in terms of its societal impact. Above all, he believed religion is about community: It binds people together (social cohesion), promotes behavior consistency (social control) and offers strength during life’s transitions and tragedies (meaning and purpose). Social conflict theory has always focused heavily on the differential distribution of resources as reflected in the socioeconomic class structure of society. Unlike functionalist theory, conflict theory sees order and harmony as superficial entities. It claims that underneath a surface of apparent harmony, there is a form of balance of power or oppression. As a result, conflict theory looks at existing social conditions and social institutions with suspicion. Karl Marx believed religion reflects the social stratification of society and maintains inequality and perpetuates the status quo. For him, religion was just an extension of working-class’ (proletariat) economic suffering. He famously argued that religion “is the opium of people”."

Berger and Luckmann have put forward a phenomenological view of religion: Religion is produced by members of society subjectively interpreting and giving meaning to the world around them. According to Berger and Luckmann, religion helps to build, maintain and legitimate universes of meaning. Throughout human history religion has played a decisive part in the construction and maintenance of universes. According to Luckmann, the function of religion can be understood to reduce uncertainty and complexity. Berger and Luckmann argue that religion is probably the most effective mechanism for the legitimation of universes of meaning. The idea that religion promotes social unity and cohesion belongs to Durkheim, who adopts a functionalist perspective towards religion."

    "explanation": "Weber is most famous for arguing that Protestantism produced modern capitalism; later in his comparative studies he attempted to demonstrate that each of the great world religions laid down the tracks along which Europe, the Islamic world, India, and China moved in their distinctive directions. According to Weber-in his classic book, <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</em>- religion responds to the basic human need to understand the purpose of life. In doing so, religion must give meaning to the social world within which life occurs. This means creating a worldview that can have social, political, and economic consequences."

      "E": "Argues that religious movements produce change."
    },
    "explanation": "When comparing Weber and Durkheim, one might start simply by noting that whereas Durkheim was interested in the generic notion of religion (specifically the classification of the sacred and profane), Weber was concerned with the historical and comparative importance of religions. Durkheim famously observed it to consist of a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things. Weber, by contrast, declared in <em>The Sociology of Religion </em>that defining religion is not possible at the start of a presentation such as this. Definition can be attempted, if at all, only at the conclusion of the study. While Weber examined the consequences of the ‘economic ethics’ of the world religions, Durkheim examined the ‘elementary forms’ of religious classification, the impact of their emotional framing, how these classificatory systems were embedded in ritual practices, and finally how the ‘collective conscience’ was an essential foundation of the social. In short, Weber’s writings on religion differ from those of Durkheim in that they concentrate on the connection between religion and social change, something to which Durkheim gave little attention. They contrast with the work of Marx, because Weber argues that religion is not necessarily a conservative force; on the contrary, religiously inspired movements have often produced dramatic social transformations."

    "explanation": "American Sociologists Roger Finke, Rodney Stark and Willams S. Bainbridge have attempted to develop a more comprehensive sociological perspective on religion. Their approach has heavily been influenced by the exchange theory that is based on the principle that all human interactions can be treated as a form of exchange. Their explanation on religion consists of a number of insights into religious organizations, institutions and religious change. Unlike Durkheim, Stark and Bainbridge see religion as meeting the needs of individuals rather than those of society as a whole. Unlike Marx, they see religion as meeting universal human needs rather than those which stem from class inequality and exploitation. Furthermore, they reject the view, shared by classic sociologists of religion that the development of industrial capitalist societies would undermine religion. Stark and Bainbridge, in their rational choice theory, suggest that religion answers universal questions and it offers compensators that meet universal human needs. According to them, religion can neither disappear nor seriously decline."

    "explanation": "Stark and Bainbridge with their religious economy approach argue that religions can be understood as organizations which are in competition with one another for followers. On the other hand, the classical theorists, Marx, Durkheim and Weber, assume that religion weakens when it is challenged by different religious or secular viewpoints whereas the religious economists argue that competition increases the overall level of religious involvement in modern society. Religious economists believe this to be true for two reasons. First, competition makes each religious group try that much harder to win followers. Second, the presence of numerous religions means that there is likely to be something for just about everyone. In culturally diverse societies, a single religion will probably appeal to only a limited range of followers while presence of Indian gurus and fundamentalist preachers, in addition to more traditional churches, is likely to encourage a high level of religious participation. Accordingly, religious economy model, that is, rational choice theory argues that the freer religious markets are, the more vital religion will be."

    "explanation": "Emile Durkheim believed that social life was impossible without the shared values and moral beliefs that form the collective conscience. In their absence, there would be no social order, social control, social solidarity or cooperation. In short, there would be no society. Religion reinforces the collective conscience.<br/>According to Durkheim, religious ritual is an important part of this social cement. Religion, through its rituals, fulfills a number of social functions such as binding people together physically, promoting social cohesion, reaffirming the group’s beliefs and values. Those functions help maintain norms, mores, and prohibitions.<br/>Durkheim is generally considered the first sociologist who analyzed religion in terms of its societal impact. Above all, he believed religion is about community: It binds people together (social cohesion), promotes behavior consistency (social control) and offers strength during life’s transitions and tragedies (meaning and purpose).<br/>As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is C. The arguments in the options I, II and III were developed by Durkheim in order to emhasize the functions of religion. The arguments in the options IV and V are the arguments of conflict theory on religion developed by Marx.<br/>Marx saw religious belief as an illusion attempting to justify existing arrangements in society and encouraging people to accept them. He saw religion doing this in two ways. First, religion justifies existing inequalities in income and power in society by explaining the position on the rich and poor as “the will of God”. For example, the Hindu religion provides a religious justification for the inequalities of the Indian caste system, and the Bible is riddled with quotations such as ‘it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven’. Poverty and resignation to it therefore become, in themselves, virtues. As a result, the poor are more likely to accept their position in society. Second, Marx believed religion provided comfort for the poor, and drew their attention away from their present misery and the inequalities and injustices of this world with promises of a future, golden life after death."

    "explanation": "The phenomenological approach is particularly associated with the work of Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann. Berger and Luckmann have put forward a phenomenological view of religion: Religion is produced by members of society subjectively interpreting and giving meaning to the world around them.<br/>According to Luckmann, the function of religion can be understood to reduce uncertainty and complexity, to determine which seems to be indeterminate, and to make accessible what seems to be inaccessible. The supernatural dimension of religion, therefore, comes in handy because it serves to reduce complexity.<br/>Berger and Luckmann argue that religion is probably the most effective mechanism for the legitimation of universes of meaning. Unlike other sources of legitimation, only religion links meaning with ultimate reality. In other words, according to Berger and Luckmann, religion is socially constructed as a means of responding to life’s uncertainties and disruptions.<br/>For Berger and Luckmann, the sociology of religion is closely related to the sociology of knowledge. For Luckmann, an important function of religion is that it helps us acquire a sense of “self”, knowing who we are, and where we fit in, a world view that endows everyday life with ultimate significance. To the extent, with regard to Berger and Luckmann’s perspective, religion provides believers with crucial explanations and meanings that they use to make sense of their lives, not least during times of personal or social crisis.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is D. The arguments in the options I, II, III and IV are the arguments of phenomenological understanding of religion. The argument in the option V is Weber’s argument. In short, Weber’s writings on religion differ from those of Durkheim in that they concentrate on the connection between religion and social change, something to which Durkheim gave little attention. They contrast with the work of Marx, because Weber argues that religion is not necessarily a conservative force; on the contrary, religiously inspired movements have often produced dramatic social transformations."

Which of the following <strong>socidagist</strong> consider religion as a tool that the upper classes use to maintain control of society and to dominate the lower classes?<br/>3. Which of the following <strong>sociologists</strong> consider religion as a tool that the upper classes use to maintain control of society and to dominate the lower classes?<br/>Members of technologically simple societies, Durkheim explained, do this with the totem, an object in the natural world collectively defined as sacred. The totem-perhaps an animal or an elaborate work of art- becomes the centerpiece of ritual, symbolizing the power of society to transform individuals into a powerful collectivity. In all its forms, Durkheim pointed out three major functions of religion for the operation of society:<br/><ol> <li>Social cohesion. Religion unites people through shared symbols, values and norms. Religious doctrine and rituals establish rules of “fair play” that make organized social life possible. In this regard, religious life emphasizes both our moral and emotional ties to others</li> <li>Social control. Every society uses religious imagery and rhetoric to promote conformity. Societies infuse many cultural norms-especially mores relating to marriage and reproduction-with religious justification. Looking beyond behavioral norms, religion confers legitimacy on the political system. In medieval Europe, in fact, monarchs claimed to rule by divine right. Few of today’s political leaders invoke religion so explicitly, but many publicly as for God’s blessing, to imply audiences that their efforts are right and just.</li> <li>Providing meaning and purpose. Religious beliefs offer the comforting sense that the vulnerable human condition serves some greater purpose. Strengthened by such convictions, people are less likely to collapse in despair when confronted by life’s distress. For this reason, major lifecourse transitions-including birth, marriage and death- are usually marked by religious observances that enhance our spiritual awareness.</li> </ol> As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is B. The concepts in the options I, II and III are the concepts associated with the functionalist theory on religion. Other concepts in the options IV and V are as follows:<br/>Alienation is a sense that our own abilities as human beings are taken over by other entities. The term was originally used by Marx to refer to the projection of human powers onto gods. Subsequently he used the term to refer to the loss of workers’ control over the nature and products of their labor<br/>Weber’s interpretation of industrial society provides one of the earliest statements of the desacralization thesis. He claimed that industrial society is “characterized by rationalization and intellectualization and, above all, by the “disenchantment of the world”. The world is no longer charged with mystery and magic; the supernatural has been banished from society. The meanings and motives with direct action are now rational. Rational action involves a deliberate and precise calculation of the importance of alternative goals and the effectiveness of the various means for attaining chosen goals. For example, if an individual’s goal is to make money, s/he will coldly and carefully calculate the necessary initial investment and the costs involved in producing and marketing a commodity in the most economical way possible. His or her measurements will be objective: they will be based on factors that can be quantified and accurately measured. S/he will reject the means to reach that goal which cannot be proven to be effective. Rational action rejects the guidelines provided by emotion, tradition or religion. It is based on the cold, deliberate reason of the intellect, which demands that the rationale for action can only be based on the proven results."

    "explanation": "Max Weber’s (1864-1920) social action theory argues that human action is directed by meanings and motives. From this perspective, action can only be understood by appreciating the world view, the image or picture of the world held by its members <strong>Weber is most famous for arguing that Protestanism produced modern capitalism;</strong> later in his comparative studies he attempted to demonstrate that each of the great world religions laid down the tracks along which Europe, the Islamic world, India, and China moved in their distinctive directions. Weber is also the systematic sociologist of stratification, bureaucracy and other non-religious social institutions; but <strong>he worked out his entire sociology in the process of tracing the patterns of historical change connected to religion.</strong><br/>According to Weber-in his classic book, <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</em>-religion responds to the basic human need to understand the purpose of life. In doing so, religion must give meaning to the social world within which life occurs. This means creating a worldview that can have social, political, and economic consequences. For instance, consider the issue of whether salvation can be achieved through active mastery (hard work, for example) or through passive contemplation (meditation). Calvinism expresses the first approach, and the second is evident in several of the Eastern religions. Using these ideas,<strong> Weber theorized that Calvinism fostered the Protestant ethic of hard work and asceticism and that Protestantism was an important influence on the development of capitalism.</strong> Calvinism is rooted in the concept of predestination, which means that before people are born, some of them are selected for heaven and others for hell. Nothing anyone does in this world, Calvinists believe, can change this.<br/>Max Weber posited that, in Europe in his time, Protestants were more likely than Catholics to value capitalist ideology, and believed in hard work and savings. <strong>He showed that Protestant values directly influenced the rise of capitalism and helped create the modern world order.</strong><br/>As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is D. The statement in the option V is about Durkheim, not Weber.<br/>When comparing Weber and Durkheim, one might start simply by noting that whereas <strong>Durkheim was interested in the generic notion of religion (specifically the classification of the sacred and profane)</strong>, Weber was concerned with the historical and comparative importance of religions. Durkheim famously observed it to consist of a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things. Weber, by contrast, declared in The Sociology of Religion that defining religion is not possible at the start of a presentation such as this."

    "explanation": "<strong>Durkheim saw religion as a source of social stability.</strong> On the other hand, German sociologist and political economist <strong>Max Weber believed religion was a precipitator of social change.</strong> Unlike Marx, Weber rejected the view that religion is always shaped by economic factors. Weber argued that, in some circumstances, religion can lead to social change: Although shared religious beliefs might integrate a social group, those same beliefs may have reflections which in the long term can produce changes in society.<br/>When comparing Weber and Durkheim, one might start simply by noting that whereas <strong>Durkheim was interested in the generic notion of religion (specifically the classification of the sacred and profane)</strong>, <strong>Weber was concerned with the historical and comparative importance of religions.</strong> Durkheim famously observed it to consist of a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things. Weber, by contrast, declared in The Sociology of Religion that defining religion is not possible at the start of a presentation such as this. Definition can be attempted, if at all, only at the conclusion of the study. While Weber examined the consequences of the ‘economic ethics’ of the world religions, Durkheim examined the ‘elementary forms’ of religious classification, the impact of their emotional framing, how these classificatory systems were embedded in ritual practices, and finally how the ‘collective conscience’ was an essential foundation of the social.<br/><strong>In short, Weber’s writings on religion differ from those of Durkheim in that they concentrate on the connection between religion and social change, something to which Durkheim gave little attention. </strong>They contrast with the work of Marx, because Weber argues that religion is not necessarily a conservative force; on the contrary, religiously inspired movements have often produced dramatic social transformations. Thus, Protestanism (particularly Puritanism) was the source of the capitalistic outlook found in the modern West. The early entrepreneurs were mostly Calvinists. Their drive to succeed, which helped initiate Western economic development, was originally prompted by a desire to serve God. Material success was, for them, a sign of divine favor. For Weber, it was religion itself, embodied in the ascetic Protestantism of the Reformation, that helped to eradicate magical notions from social life and to begin a radical ‘disenchantment’ of the modern World.<br/>As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is B. Options II and IV are about Weber."

Marx’s social conflict approach considers religion as opium and consolation or, on rare occasions, a sort of protest.

Although he studied the religions around the world in detail for many years, Weber became famous for his explanation of the emergence of Capitalism in the West through asceticism principle of the Protestant ethic. Among the leading theorists of the Phenomenological Approach, Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann argue that religion helps people construct a universe of meaning in order to understand and interpret the world, and justify the authenticity and reality of those frames of meaning.<br/>According to Durkheim, all societies have a continuing need to reaffirm and uphold their basic sentiments and values. This is accomplished when people come together and communally proclaim their acceptance of the dominant belief system. In this way, people are bound to one another, and as a result, the stability of the society is strengthened. Not only does religion in itself bring about social cohesion, but often, the hostility and prejudice directed at its members by outsiders also helps strengthen bonds between those members. Durkheim believes that religion strengthens the unity of society and promotes solidarity."

He famously argued that religion “is the opium of people”. Marx considered religion <strong>inseparable </strong>from the economy and the worker. Religion could not be understood apart from the capitalist society that maintained inequality. The correct answer is B."

    "explanation": "Norms: Values gain efficiency through norms. The social norms emerge in the form of religious rules, moral rules, manners and customs, etiquette and legal rules in social life. The norms are cultural<br/>rules, which arise with the reward and punishment system and affect the individuals’ behaviors. All cultures, subcultures and groups have distinctive and specific norms that direct correct behaviors. The acts and laws, rules about clothing, games and sports, etc. all reflect social norms (Yüksel, 2015: 19; Schaefer, 2010:171; Johnson, 2000:209; Milovanovic, 2003:6).<br/>The rules are required for a society. There will be chaos in a society, where norms do not exist. The norm is a system of rules with sanctions. The individuals could predict how other individuals would behave in the same situation thanks to these rules, which determine the limits of attitudes and behaviors. As shared cultural expectations, social norms enable people to live together in a society (Dönmezer, 1978: 245; İçli, 2002: 105; Newman and O’Brien, 2006: 71; Andersen and Taylor, 2005: 449). For example, family relations, political structure, production and consumption activities and traffic rules operate in accordance with certain norms. The individuals learn the norms in the process of socialization. When the norms are not complied with, social sanctions are imposed. The measure of sanction is proportional to severity of the norm. An individual who faces social punishment arranges his attitudes and behaviors accordingly."

Since the norms direct almost all human activities, the limits of the concept of deviance are as broad as possible. For this reason, deviance encompasses the violation of group norms that are not legally expressed or are not mentioned in the law. Deviance could be rewarded, punished or accepted without penalty or reward. In general terms, deviance can be defined as the visible violation of cultural norms."

Sutherland from the Chicago approach also made important contributions to the issue of deviance on the basis of the interactionist approach along with the differentiated unity approach. According to Sutherland, crime is something that is learned, just like other social phenomenan. Crime is learned in interaction with other individuals as a result of a communication process, and deviance depends on whether or not a behavior is encouraged at a certain level by others."

Lombroso, who made analyses at prisons, suggests that the criminals resemble humans’ ape-like ancestors. Lombroso examined the physical properties of criminals such as skull and forehead shape, jaw size and limb length, and suggested that they exhibit features from earlier stages of human evolution and that they return to primitive forms of humanity."

When these functions are resolved, the crime will be better understood. (2) Deviance depends on conflict. Social strata are related to interests especially economic ones.

This is caused by the problems encountered by individuals who try to integrate with a new social environment through urbanization and internal migration. The general view, suggesting that the crime rates have increased in recent years in Turkey, has received considerable support from the public.

While the classical sociologists like Durkheim, Weber and Marx provided important contributions in terms of the changing role of the law and its relation to social change, Eugene Elrich, Nicholas Timasheff and George Gurvitch provided the theoretical competence for the sociology of law during the 20thcentury. As Ehrlich was an Austrian lawyer, he lived in the Austro-Hungarian Empire at that time. His work dating back to 1913 and entitled Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law has been translated into many languages and has become one of the masterpieces of the sociology of law."

    },
    "explanation": "Deviance in the daily language means departing from a recognized path and refers to actions that do not fit the expectations and norms of a particular social group. In general terms, deviance could be defined as thevisible violation of cultural norms. Since the norms direct almost all human activities, the limits of the concept of deviance are as broad as possible. For this reason, deviance encompasses the violation of group norms that are not legally expressed or are not mentioned in the law. Deviance could be rewarded, punished or accepted without penalty or reward."

    },
    "explanation": "The concept of social control refers to the strategies and techniques aimed at preventing the deviant human behavior in a society in order to achieve social order in a broad sense. These strategies and techniques might emerge in all levels of society. Social control is, in a sense, an attempt to regulate the thoughts and behaviors of a society and people, and everyone in a society is subject to social control. We are socialized within family to obey our parents because they are our parents. The groups of friends, universities, bureaucratic organizations and governments set social norms and ensure that their members comply with them. Deviance might deal with formal and informal sanctions, as required by social control. However, the process of social control is usually informal, as in the case of parents who rebuke their children or young people who mock their friends because of their way of dressing. People who display deviant behavior may face disapproval, loss of friends, fines, or even imprisonment. In cases of severe deviance, the criminal justice system, namely, formal intervention emerges."

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "options": {
      "A": "Modernist theories",
      "B": "Postmodern theories",
      "C": "Conflict Theories",

    },
    "explanation": "Conflict theories have also macro characteristics just like the functionalist theory and focus on the social structure. In these approaches, the views that deviance is determined by factors such as biology, anomie, social disorder or labels are not accepted. The main argument of conflict theories, based on Marx’s thoughts, is that individuals are actively involved in deviant behaviors as a reaction to the inequalities of capitalist order and that the laws and other norms exist in order to protect the interests of strong members of society. For example, according to sociologist Richard Quinney, the criminal justice system serves the interests of dominant powers. Crime, according to Quinney, is a definition of conduct created by - such as legislators and law enforcement officers - in a politically organized society."

    "explanation": "White-collar crimes are committed by individuals belonging to wealthy segments of society, such as tax evasion, illegal sales, securities and real estate frauds and embezzlement. Measuring the distribution of white-collar crimes is more difficult than other crimes because most of these types of crimes are not included in official statistics. These crimes are actually more harmful than other crimes and are more prevalent in industrial societies. The correct answer is B."
