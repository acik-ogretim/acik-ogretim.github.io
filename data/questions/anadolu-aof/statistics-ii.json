Thus, the required information can be achieved quickly.<br/>Accuracy<br/>While a census data is gathered, many unexpected problems may affect the accuracy of the results such as recording errors, copying errors, false recordings by interviewers etc. So, while working with census data, we may inadvertently come across with a figure for a population parameter being further away than the actual value. With a good sampling procedure using good sampling methods and by choosing random observations, actually we can be very close to the true value of the population parameter.<br/>Physical Impossibility<br/>Some populations are uncountable or infinite to conduct a census. In this situation, it is impossible to consider all the elements of a population. Thus, a sample is necessary to obtain information from a population.<br/>Destructive Tests<br/>If a test includes the destruction of an item or product, sampling should be used. For example, when a car manufacturer would like to get a safety rating on their cars, they send a selection of cars (3 to 5 cars) to the safety agency for testing and these cars goes under different test including a crash which demolishes the car."

It would be impossible to take all the water in the lake. Another example is the geographical size of the area that would be covered in the survey. Think about New York City, the population density is over 27,000 people square miles. Population density of Turkmenistan is 10.5 people per square km. Whereas the population density of Turkey is 104 people per square km. Now in your spare time, look at the maps of these countries and make a comparison of the sizes of these countries then you may see that how difficult it could be if you want to conduct a census in Turkmenistan."

A chain index is an index number where the value of any given period is relative to the value of the preceding period. Remember that in the fixed-base index, the index value of each period in a time series is directly related to the value of a fixed base period.

    "explanation": "Laspeyres Index was created by the German economist Étienne Laspeyres. The technique designed by Laspeyres uses base-period weights. It consists of the information about the price and quantity of products in different periods. The weighting scheme makes it a better tool than simple indexes. By using the Laspeyres index, it is possible to make a comparison of today’s price and quantity between the price and quantity of items altogether for a base period. The Laspeyres price index is also known as the average of weighted relative prices since it is a composite index number of prices formed by the weighted sum method. The index is found by the ratio of the sum of prices in the current period to the sum of the prices in the base period, these sums are weighted by the respective quantities of the base period. In this case, the weights which are used are the quantities of each commodity in the base period. So, it measures the relative price change of the commodities when the respective quantities are considered unchanged. The correct answer is B."

In the simple index calculation, the ratio of the two variables is converted to a percentage. In other words, index numbers are the percentage of a comparison with a reference value written without the percent symbol. It is important to determine what to write in the reference value field since the simple index calculations can be examined as a fixed based method and chain-based method. In applications, two types of indexes dominate, which are price and quantity indexes. The correct answer is B."

    "explanation": "The sign test gets its name from the negative and positive signs of the mathematical difference of the observations’ measurements. It is used for the hypothesis test about the population median, M. Inferences about the population median are important when the population has highly skewed distribution. In skewed distributions, the population median is more centrally located than the population mean. Therefore, population median is accepted as better estimator for the measure of location if the population is skewed. The sign test is a non-parametric alternative test for one sample t test, paired sample t test, and a research in which quantitative measurements is impossible but in which it is possible to rank the measurements with respect to each other."

    "explanation": "This method is also known as Wald’s pessimism criterion. In here, the decision maker follows a pessimistic approach to solve the decision problem. The decision maker tries to minimize the damage since the overall approach is to look for the best among the worst payoff values. Decision maker creates the payoff table table either profit or cost based for each combination of (decision alternative, state of nature). Then, the decision maker chooses the minimum or maximum payoff value for each decision alternative, and then decision maker selects the decision alternative that gives the lowest or highest of these payoffs."

    "explanation": "In a paper in 1951, Leonard Hurwicz suggested a new method that balances the optimism and pessimism of the decision maker. In this method, the decision maker is allowed to have best and worst possible outcomes considered. In order to achieve this, Hurwicz suggests the use of coefficient of optimism. It is symbolized with α and it is a decimal number between 0 and 1. If α = 1, then the decision maker is hundred percent optimistic. If α = 0, then the decision maker is hundred percent pessimistic. Since α is the level of optimism we may easily call 1 - α as the level of pessimism in the decision problem. Therefore, by changing the value of the α, the decision maker may try to balance the optimism and pessimism."
