In simple majority, the affirmative vote requirement is more than half of all votes cast. In qualified majority, affirmative votes should be more than half of the votes cast. Finally unanimity, contrary to the general understanding, does not require affirmative votes of all members but simply seeks that no single negative vote is cast. So absences or abstentions are ignored which in turn means that members that do not effectively want to block (“veto”) a resolution may well prefer either not participating the voting or being present but casting a blank vote.

This is also because of the fact that the ways/means of industrial production have changed dramatically in the last decades. States do not constitute “specialised industrial production units” anymore. Production process itself is fragmented and various parts of almost all sorts of goods are produced and assembled in different countries. No country is the sole producer, and thus the sole exporter, of no goods. International market is not anymore an exchange platform of final products, but rather that of intermediate goods. Exporting and importing (of different parts of a single product) are intertwined and neither can be possible and even meaningful without the other. So, cooperation is increasingly becoming a sine qua non for all States if they want to co-produce something. Moreover, since factors of production are scattered around the world and particularly cheap labour force might well be found in quite far regions, economic cooperation is not anymore limited with the neighbouring countries either. In fact, State practices do confirm this trend, as economic organizations that are increasingly becoming inevitable are not necessarily established at regional levels between States that share common borders. As can be understood from the information given, the correct answer is E. All arguments given in the answer choices be used in order to argue that no country is the sole producer, and thus the sole exporter, of no goods."

    "explanation": "Recommended Correction<br/>Page 7<br/>Best known and most quoted theories of international politics are realism and liberalism (idealism, rationalism).<br/><strong>Writing idealism and rationalism in parenthesis may be misunderstood as if they were the synonmys for realism and liberalism.</strong><br/>There are also major theoretical approaches that endeavour to explain regional and international organizations. It must be emphasised at the outset that theories do not determine and designate politics. International actors such as States, organizations and other emerging non-State actors do shape politics. Theories simply claim to explain politics from usually solely a certain angle.<br/>Realism argue that organizations are a result of States’ seek of security. They, as the main if not the sole actor of international relations, simply want to maximise their interests and survive in a world of homo homini lupus.<br/>Liberals (idealists, rationalists) think differently. They suggest that States are not (potential) enemies but (potential) partners, as they basically stand for providing welfare and peace to their respective citizens. It then means that cooperation especially in between economically coherent States is vital.<br/>Regional organizations in particular are established to foster common interests and thus realise the win-win principle. Mutual interdependence thus fixed intensifies and deepens over time in such a fashion that war and even conflict becomes needles and even undesired. The most advanced version of this approach is represented by the functionalist integration theories. As used to explain supranational regional organizations such as the EU, it is argued that a close cooperation on non-controversial practical, technical, economic and legal issues rather than political and military ones would not only create a “common peace and welfare zone”, but also strengthen a sense of commonness and togetherness in between citizens. <br/>Critical theories usually emphasises the uneven and hegemonic nature of international and regional relations.

It ordinarily meets sparsely, say annually or even once in two years, to discuss, consult and negotiate general issues on its agenda.<br/>Almost all organizations have a core specially authorised body which is usually called council or board and is equipped with special powers.

    "explanation": "In the voting method, each member casts its vote on a draft resolution and the decision is deemed to be taken if the affirmative votes exceed a certain number or ratio. In simple majority, the affirmative vote requirement is more than half of all votes cast. In qualified majority, affirmative votes should be more than half of the votes cast. Finally unanimity, contrary to the general understanding, does not require affirmative votes of all members but simply seeks that no single negative vote is cast. So absences or abstentions are ignored which in turn means that members that do not effectively want to block (“veto”) a resolution may well prefer either not participating the voting or being present but casting a blank vote. As can be understood from the information given, the correct answer is C. Consensus is a model where decisions are taken without voting. Each and every member holds the right to express its opinion on a draft resolution. Objections, suggestions, proposals and amendment requests are voiced until a compromise and consent is reached at. At a point where no party raises further issues, the resolution is assumed to be assented. In cases where the matter in question directly relates a member State, the organizations may prefer consensus minus one procedure according to which that State is denied to have its say due to the principle nemo judex in sua causa (no-one should be a judge in his own cause)."

    "explanation": "Recommended Correction<br/>… as well as <strong>regular, budgets</strong> in order to…<br/>… as well as <strong>regular budgets</strong> in order to...<br/>Organizations require material, physical and economic means to carry out their activities and perform their duties. This is because the expenses incurred to run and fund daily work, activities and fixed costs such as personal salaries and infrastructural expenditures are all to be met by the organization itself. That’s why organizations have their own budgets generated and set with the contributions of the members. Organizations have two basic kinds of budgets. Budgets that depend on the yearly contributions of the members as well as on other regular revenues and incomes of the organizations are mostly called regular budgets. These budgets towards planned or projected activities and expenditures of relevant bodies and organs of the organizations are in principle approved and audited by the plenary bodies. As a huge difference in between financial means and contributions of the members may cause an imbalance among members for the advantage and benefit of influential ones, organizations usually set ceiling and minimum rates so that no member disproportionally finances, and thus seeks to influence, the organization. As States that do not pay their contributions timely may pose important financial problems, organizations reserve the right to impose sanctions including the suspension of the voting right. Yet there are cases where an influential State is but only kindly requested to pay its huge amount of arrears whereas a weak State is denied its voting right due to a relatively much smaller amount of yearly contribution. Organizations may also need additional financial means for unusual or extraordinary activities and expenditures. Ad hoc budgets are raised in such cases with the contributions of willing members. There are members who contribute to ad hoc, as well as regular, budgets in order to increase their respective influences within and outside the organization. Likewise, members sometimes contribute to ad hoc budgets with very small and even symbolic amounts just to demonstrate their positions and alignments. In short, budgeting systems of organizations are too not of mere economic and financial character but also have political dimensions, repercussions and effects. All statements in the answer choices are correct, so the correct answer is E."

The Committee guarantees that the voices of all the different groups and interests in society are heard and considered at the top levels of EU policy and decision-making."

Fourth, an INGO should declare it will not rely on any violent measure whatsoever to pursue its goals. Fifth, an INGO should not act in a way that could be interpreted as an interference with the internal affairs of states. Even this set of principles fall short to offer an overall definition of an NGO which is inherently diverse and vague. Some INGOs proclaim a broad mandate whereas others may confine themselves to a specific agenda and cause. While some maintain a presence in a vast geography, some others may prefer remaining local or regional. It all depends on how an INGO identifies itself, its orientation and its goals. Naturally, their audience, the type of problems they are addressing, their constituency as well as opportunities they are able to enjoy all have to impact upon the kind of INGO that emerges.For instance, the INGOs are more concerned about how to make a contribution to the making of international law whereas national or regional NGOs are often focused on local political issues. Likewise, third world NGOs may employ domestic government whereas NGOs in developed countries have a strict code by which they prohibit admission of members with government connections. Additionally, while most third world NGOs are dedicated to the resolution of the economic problems and pay greater attention to humanitarian issues, the NGOs in the developed world are more focused on civil and political rights, and, for instance, committed to fair trial. These NGOs address problems pertinent to a violation of fundamental human rights rather than the betterment of a certain community or group and believe “in a pluralist society functioning within a framework of rules impartially applied to protect individuals against state interference” (Steiner, 1981: 15-16). It should be noted that lack of governmental support for their activities and the huge diversity in terms of their orientation and structure does not necessarily mean that INGOs are weak or ineffective. To the contrary, thanks to their diverse nature and flexibility, the INGOs are better able to address normative issues including human rights violations and environmental degradation. Similarly, their independent and private status enables the INGOs to act free of political oversight by the state. More importantly, because they do not have to consider the possible impact of their action upon a certain foreign policy design, the NGOs are often able to concentrate on a certain agenda. The proceeding sections dwell upon the role of INGOs in the international and regional organizations."

Some prerequisites for admission into this status, albeit not formally identified, might be underlined. In this respect, Peter Willetts (2001), an eminent scholar studying civil society actors, provides at least fifth principles in order for an INGO to qualify for the definition of the UN. First, an INGO needs to work in furtherance of the goals and objectives of the UN. Second, an INGO should allow fair representation by members, establish a headquarters, and employ officers. Third, an INGO should be a non-profit organization without engaging in business or corporate activities.
