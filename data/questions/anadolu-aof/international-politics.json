    "explanation": "Mikhail Gorbachev, who took the USSR presidency in 1985, had a policy agenda to reform the country in a liberal way to overcome economic crises in the country. The reform was symbolized with four concepts: glasnost (openness), perestroika (restructuring), demokratizatsiya (democratization), and uskoreniye (acceleration of economic development). Then, synchronized with democratic reforms, ethnic and nationalist opposition movements and economic crises led the country into a dissolution. In December 1991, Gorbachev declared the end of USSR, and the Russian Federation was founded with the presidency of Boris Yeltsin. Russian Federation pursued market privatization and trade liberalization policies as well to get structurally ready to be a member of globalized world. Globalization and liberalization became the most popular concept during the fall of Eastern bloc. However, Fukuyama (1992) announced the end of ideologies and the triumph of liberalism over communism. Fall of USSR signified the standardization of ideologies and value sets all over the world, which was Western type of democracy, human rights, and liberalism."

Terrorist attacks hit Pentagon and World Trade Centre. Al Qaeda undertook the attacks, and Afghanistan intervention of USA started a couple of days later. War against terrorism was the motto of the new era, and USA regarded itself responsible to fight against terrorist groups all over the world. Also, President G. W. Bush entitled states that support terrorism as “axis of evil”, and perceived them as enemies of the world order. Iraq intervention in 2003, alleged possession of mass destruction weapons, was another part of the war against terrorism. States like Libya, North Korea, Iran and Venezuela were listed among the axis of evil states by their anti-democratic behaviours."

Thus, with the economic partnership of the nearby cities, the evolution of the peoples into a national identity developed simultaneously.

Traditional approaches include Realism and Liberalism. They have a state-centric approach to the analysis of international organizations. For them, states are both principal actors of international system and also rational actors making cost-benefit analysis of every alternative and select the ones that maximize their benefits. Revisionist approaches, including Functionalism, Neo-functionalism and Transactionalism go beyond the state-centric approach and examine international organizations as significant actors beside states. These are mostly known as international integration theories."

For Realist thinkers, states are principal international actors, and international organizations (for them, it refers to intergovernmental organizations not international non-governmental organizations) only matters if they serve interests of states. According Realist thinkers, international politics have an anarchic structure in which there is no common authority over and above the sovereign state, or a lack of government at the international level. Realists claim that in anarchic international system, states cannot trust each other and they always fear of cheating and thus this makes interstate cooperation difficult to achieve. For Realists, main motivation of states in anarchic international system is survival, i.e. preserving the existence of the state, because of this, states cannot rely on other states or international organizations for their defence and must rely on its own resources for survival, which is called as self-help. Realists claim that international organizations are just instruments used by states in their quest for power and interest. Realists also believe that another factor which makes interstate cooperation difficult to achieve is that states are preoccupied with making relative gains (improvements in a state’s position relative to other states)."

The suffix in the word of regionalism suggests a conscious set of related ideas or ideology that is capable of forming the basis of a political movement or an intellectual trend.

Firstly, regional policy in this point is “a set of agreed and organized measures for ensuring development across certain territory”; traditionally, nation state. Regional economic policy or regional planning includes all forms of public interventions for geographical placement of economic activity. Secondly, regional policy attempts to make corrections in free market economy for attainment of two interrelated objectives: improved social distribution and economic growth."

When social regionalism refers to the fact that the divergent electoral behaviour of different regions is often simply a reflection of their different social composition, economic regionalism describes the fact that the geographical concentration of a particular industry may lead voters in a region to develop a distinct sense of shared economic interest. Finally, the third form of (political) regionalism, is cultural regionalism that could emerge if significant groups of voters come to question the legitimacy of the state as a provider of public goods. Additionally, it is possible to make clear that economic and cultural regionalism emerge from a process of social interaction and various processes."

    "explanation": "First of all, it is an important starting point to<br/>question what the concept of the right itself means<br/>and whether is possible to have a common definition<br/>of a right on all humanity. The sources of rights, how<br/>to classify different rights, and to what extent rights<br/>are universal stand as important questions that must<br/>be discussed in human rights theory. In addition to<br/>these, there is a wide debate about the conditions of<br/>respect for human rights and the causes of human<br/>rights violations in the literature.<br/>The question of what the source of rights is has<br/>been discussed, in particular, in the literature of<br/>law, from past to present. In this context, it is often<br/>argued that a source of rights is the law of nature.<br/>The acquisition of human rights together with the<br/>birth of man has had a broad philosophical support,<br/>especially by social contractors. However, there are<br/>other explanations with regard to the source of<br/>rights.

      "E": "The development and expansion of positive status rights has been faster and less painful than others."
    },
    "explanation": "Human rights have been expressed in various<br/>circles from ancient Greece to Rome and from<br/>institutional belief systems to non-institutional<br/>belief systems. This is because human rights have<br/>been thought as a common research subject to<br/>philosophy and theology. Aristotle’s and Plato’s<br/>emphasis on the concept of right, the Stoic’s<br/>emphasis on the common values of humanity in<br/>the framework of cosmopolitanism, or underlining<br/>some moral values, especially compassion, in some<br/>interpretations of beliefs such as Christianity,<br/>Judaism and Islam, might be related to human<br/>rights in one way or another. (Ishay 2004, 23-25;<br/>James 2007, 7-10; Vincent 2010, 39). However,<br/>human rights gain its present meaning throughout<br/>the modern times. It is the result of a nearly three<br/>centuries of struggle that started with the English Revolution and continued with the American and French Revolutions. All in all, these struggles<br/>have been aimed to restrict the monarchies with<br/>unlimited powers. Revolutionary developments towards<br/>fundamental rights occurred in England in the<br/>17th century. In this period, the existence of<br/>some untouchable rights was vigorously spoken,<br/>and these fundamental rights were defended<br/>against the authorities of that time. The precise<br/>establishment of the parliamentary to control<br/>the British monarchy and the limitation of the<br/>monarch’s authority undoubtedly constituted a<br/>major break in the political history. Although the first efforts to establish<br/>fundamental rights pointed to the 17th century, the<br/>widening and deepening of the rights have spread<br/>over many years. However, it was required to wait<br/>for the 19th century to build mass democracies<br/>through which political rights are guaranteed. However, the development and expansion of positive status rights have been more painful and<br/>prolonged than others. Undoubtedly, the socialist<br/>movement that became more widespread in the<br/>1848 revolution, the Chartist movement, and the<br/>aftermath, laid the groundwork for the emergence<br/>of the Welfare state. According to these, the wrong phrase is given in option E."

    "explanation": "One of the most important approaches to the classification of rights belongs to Georg Jellinek. This classification of negative status rights, positive status rights, and active status rights can be roughly described as follows: Negative status rights emphasize the restrictions of states and personal immunity. In other words, the conceptualization of negative rights, which point to a protected area in which states could not intervene in any way, constituted the basis for preventing the state’s tyranny. Positive status rights, on the other hand, emphasize the need for states to take on various responsibilities and to strengthen social and economic conditions."

    },
    "explanation": "Another important point to be emphasized about human rights is the consideration that the development of human rights is largely Western-centric. In that regard, there is a large body of literature on the universality and locality of human rights (see Clapham 2007, 66; Donnelly 2007, 37-53; Freeman 2012, 126-132). In this sense, for example, the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights realized at the World Conference on Human Rights (1993) is important because apart from the fact that the first comprehensive debate within the framework of relativity-universality debate was conducted here, the role of rights in the development of economy has been discussed as well (Brown 2006, 700; Freeman 2012, 55; Patricia 1993, 218)."

Some efforts to tackle intergovernmental relations through international legal arrangements and organizations have been shaped by The Hague Conventions and the Geneva Protocol. Undoubtedly, all these arrangements served as an important cornerstone in the formation of the law of war. With these arrangements, it was aimed to protect the civilians and rules to be followed in the war based on the jus in bello principle within the framework of just war theory (Abele 2011; Brown 2006, 694; Nabulsi 1999, 25)."

For example, the European Union effectively implements this principle in the process of membership, while encouraging candidate members to take steps in line with democratization and human rights (Smith 2005; Schimmelfennig 2007; Usul 2011, 43-71)."

    },
    "explanation": "Unlike realists, who try to read international relations from a perspective of power and security, liberals question the possibilities of cooperation in international relations (Jackson and Sørensen 2010, 96). Liberal theorists, also, emphasize that different entities, including international organizations and non-governmental organizations, are influential at certain levels in the decision-making process of governments. In particular, the emphasis on international organizations is that they are dialogue spaces where misunderstandings are abolished in one way, and the other is that they are the mechanisms that enable the harmonization of interstate interests (Keohane and Martin 1995, 41-42). In this framework, it will be possible for human rights to meet at the level of the state community, largely through the efforts of international institutions. In general, regulations in international institutions result in the emergence of international regimes in the long run. As Keohane describes, regimes are the consequences of contacts that lead to convergence among rational actors on certain issues (Keohane, 2009). Human rights regimes, which are becoming widespread and have a common will to overcome human rights violations, should be considered in this context (Donnelly 1986; Moravcsik 1995; Moravcsik 2000). A more indirect relationship between liberalism and human rights can be established within the framework of democratic peace theology of liberal theory. As a matter of fact, the reluctance of democracies to use force in internal politics, as it is in international politics, is often emphasized. So much so that a broad empirical literature has been built on the sensitivity democracies have in protecting human rights (Davenport 1999; Davenport 2007)."

    "explanation": "Most, if not all, Third World states are artificial designs of colonial powers in the past.

Collusion of interests of intra- and extra- regional states, usually in the form of opposing regional balances, over a specific security issue creates war, displacement, refugees, poverty, and, in most cases, stalemate and prolongation of disagreement over the dispute. This makes that state or group of states in the Third World spend more to the armament."

The concept of the Securitisation, formulated in the works of Ole Waever, Barry Buzan and Jaap de Wilde, broadens content of security by including military and non-military fields into the security studies. Most importantly, it introduces the view that a specific matter or security problem is actually engendered and constructed through multiple and complex internal processes as being an existential security threat. In other words, the concept of the Securitisation identifies how, why, and by whom a particular issue becomes securitised (securitisation) and de-securitized (de-securitisation). The concept of the Securitisation can, thus, be classified as a Constructivist approach since it deals with subjective matters."

Mistrust is the common attitude of states towards each other in an anarchic international system and states cannot rely on any promises of other states or international institutions, but only on themselves, self-help (Terriff et al., 1999: 31-32)."

As mentioned earlier, the Zealots had a political goal (destroying the Roman rule in the Palestine), had an organization, and committed violent acts, thus, complying with all classical three components of a terrorist organization. The Assassins also had a strong religious motivation derived from the Shi’a’s Ismailiyya interpretation. Putting aside these religiously motivated terror groups in the history which were already covered, other terror groups and terrorist tactics adopted by states with religious motivations will be discussed in this section. The link argued to be exist between terrorism with religious motivations and Islam and Muslims will also be challenged after having a brief overview of different terror groups with different religious motivations sometimes attacking their co-religionists due to sectarian differences, bombing people with chemicals in order to “bring the apocalypse earlier” or “purify the world”, and killing people just because of their different religious identity.\n The tragic incident of the 9/11 attacks carried out by Al-Qaeda and subsequent declaration of a “Global War on Terror” by the then US President George W. Bush resulted in a higher attention to the subject more than ever. Even though Al-Qaeda and ISIS/ISIL/DAESH are the two most “famous” examples of this category, various groups with different religious motivations resorted to terrorism over centuries."

The Assassin’s transboundary character is also a predecessor for contemporary transnational terrorist networks. The Assassins were thus, quite organized, able to control strategic strongholds, capable of influencing, manipulating and assassinating key figures, successful in defying several sieges by quite powerful states of their time, and proved to have a quite a sustainable modus operandi considering their several centuries of presence which is quite uncommon for terror groups. Thus, they are widely regarded as early experts of terror and guerrilla tactics and a key predecessor of contemporary terror groups (Daftary, 2016; Gray, 2010; McCarthy, 1973; Lockhart, 1930)."

The famous “September decree” of 1793 officially declared that the Reign of Terror is “the order of the day” and thus the republic would use terror against its “enemies” in order to preserve the republic and the achievements of the revolution."

Their developmental planning policies resulted in implementations of forced labour, internal displacement, expropriation and nationalization of foreign investments. In close connection with the developmental goals, these countries tried to construct their populations as members of a single communal identity adopted by the state authorities. Certainly, this approach resulted in violent repression against parts of the populations from various ethnic groups, religious communities or ideological affinities.\n Numerous examples of repressive identity politics can be given as they were implied in the Second World during the Cold War such as the USSR under the presidency of Stalin."
