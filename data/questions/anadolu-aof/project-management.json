For example, a raw food workshop might be organized between January 25 and February 3. However, a bridge project for Bosphorus can take four years. 3. A project may be unique or may have some unique elements. Especially, megaprojects like Panama Canal are unique since they have never been done before. Other projects like building a shopping mall or an apartment building include established set of routines. On the other hand, these projects are also unique because of the customization. 4. A project uses various resources to conduct project activities. Such resources can involve people, equipment, material, machines and facilities.

The<br/>fundamental attributes of a project are given as follows:<br/>1. A project states certain specific objectives that can be defined in terms of schedule and cost. For<br/>example, the objective of a project might be to plan a wedding in six months and within a budget<br/>of $8,000. It is expected that the wedding will meet the performance predefined by the bride and<br/>groom.<br/>2. As stated in the definition of project, projects are temporary activities. They have a definite<br/>beginning and ending point, and they can last minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years. For<br/>example, a raw food workshop might be organized between January 25 and February 3. However,<br/>a bridge project for Bosphorus can take four years.<br/>3. A project may be unique or may have some unique elements. Especially, megaprojects like Panama<br/>Canal are unique since they have never been done before. Other projects like building a shopping<br/>mall or an apartment building include established set of routines. On the other hand, these projects<br/>are also unique because of the customization.<br/>4. A project uses various resources to conduct project activities. Such resources can involve<br/>people, equipment, material, machines and facilities. For example, a bridge project may<br/>include resources such as machines, concrete, labor and so on."

    "explanation": "The Importance of Project<br/>Management<br/>Project Management Institute had more than 24,000 members in 1997 and current membership is now over 500,000 with members from different countries. It is the best indicator of the rapid growth and interest in project management. An increasing percentage of the organization’s effort is being devoted to projects. In below, some of the reasons why importance of project management is increasing according to Gray and Larson (2000)<br/>are described:<br/>• Compression of the Product Life Cycle:<br/>One of the most important reasons for demanding a project management process is product life cycles. For today, products in high-tech industries have an average life cycle between 1-3 years. Just 30 years ago, the average life cycle was 10 to 15 years, which was considered normal. Because of the short life cycles, when the product will enter the market is important . This situation is so important that if a high-tech products development project delays six months, the revenue will decrease 33 percent. • Global Competition: Today’s market expects better products for lower prices. This makes the ISO 9000 -international standards for quality and guarantee managements- mandatory for production all over the world. These standards are applicable for every possible business in terms of quality assurance, design and delivery processes. Therefore, project<br/>management is an efficient way to get work done under favor of its focus on time, cost and performance.<br/>• Knowledge Explosion: Over the years, knowledge of new things has significantly increased, which leads to complexity in projects. In the beginning of 1900s, building a railroad was not that complex.<br/>But today there are many variables like materials, equipment, codes, required specialists etc. This complexity needs different technologies to integrate with. Project management succeeded to making things possible.<br/>• Corporate Downsizing: In the last years, organizational life has changed dramatically. With rising expenses, many companies tried to downsize and focusing core qualifications to survive. Also, today’s organizations are flatter and leaner, and they need a change. In this respect, project management does the work of middle management for improving things. Downsizing also lets companies approach their projects differently.<br/>• Increased Customer Focus: Competition between companies have increased the value for customers. Customers want more specific products for their needs and enjoyment over the old generic products. This situation necessitates a closer relationship between the customer and the producer. Because of that, sales representatives evolve into project managers for answering their customers’ specific needs. With the increased customer needs, customized products became more common in the industry. For example, if you want to buy a golf club about 10 years ago, you only looked for price and feeling. But today, there are many golf clubs like long<br/>or short handles, for power shots or more technical shots etc. Project management has become mandatory for producing that kind of customized products for customer satisfaction.<br/>• Rapid Development of Third World and Closed Economies:<br/>With the fall of Soviet<br/>Union and Communist Asian countries’ opening to world, people in these countries exploded the demand of customer goods and infrastructure development. Western companies had a very big chance for introducing their products to new markets. Within all these processes, project management helped a lot for finding new istribution channels and global operations. These big changes in the world created a huge market for construction and<br/>telecommunications, especially in eastern Europe and Asian countries who were trying to reconstruct their ndustry."

    "explanation": "The outcomes of a project are generally evaluated by three factors: <strong>cost, schedule, </strong>and <strong>performance</strong>. The cost of a project is the budget which represents financial limits that are needed for the project implementation. It might include labor costs, material procurement costs, and operating costs. The project schedule is the timetable that shows in detail when each activity should begin and end. The last one is required performance. It is expected that the outcomes of the project meet the requirements of the customers. The correct answer is B."

      "D": "A work package may include several milestones",
      "E": "A work package should fit organizational procedures and culture"
    },
    "explanation": "Seven important points about defining a project work package are as follows:<br/>• The work package typically forms the lowest level in the WBS. Although some projects may employ the term subtask, the majority leave work package-level activities as the most basic WBS step.<br/>• A work package has a deliverable result. Each work package should have its own outcome. One work package does not summarize or modify another. Together, work packages identify all the work that must be contributed to complete the project.<br/>• A work package has one owner assigned-a project team member who will be most responsible for that package’s completion. Although other team members can provide support as needed, only one person should be directly answerable for the work package.<br/>• A work package may be considered by its owner as a project in itself. If we adopt the notion that all work packages, because they are of finite length and budget and have a specific deliverable, can be considered miniature projects, each package owner can view his activities as a micro project.<br/>• A work package may include several milestones. A milestone is defined as a significant event in the project. Depending on the size and complexity of a project work package, it may contain a number of significant checkpoints or milestones that determine its progress toward completion.<br/>• A work package should fit organizational procedures and culture. Tasks undertaken to support project outcomes should be in accord with the overall cultural norms of the project organization. Performing a work package should never lead a team member to violate company policy (either codified or implicit); that is, assigned activities must pass both relevant legal standards for ethical behaviour and also adhere to the accepted behaviours and procedures of the organization.<br/>• The optimal size of a work package may be expressed in terms of labour hours, calendar time, cost, report period, and risks. All work packages should be capable of being tracked, meaning that they must be structured to allow the project manager to monitor their progress. Progress is usually a measurable concept, delineated by metrics such as time and cost."

Work packages are short-duration tasks that have a definite start<br/>and stop point, consume resources, and represent cost. Each work package is a control point. A work package manager is responsible for seeing that the package is completed on time, within budget, and according to the technical specifications. To review, each package in the WBS, a work package manager;<br/>1. defines work (what),<br/>2. identifies time to complete a work package (how long),<br/>3. identifies a time-phased budget to complete a work package (cost),<br/>4. identifies resources needed to complete a work package (how much),<br/>5. identifies a single person responsible for units of work (who), and<br/>6. identifies monitoring points for measuring progress (how well)."

With the nodes, the beginning and finishing events are represented, and the arrow between these two nodes depicts the activity itself, which is different from AON. The events are identified by the number inside each node. Activity duration is shown by the number over the line unlike AON. A “dummy” activity is not used in AON.

    "explanation": "The resource allocation is the second step of the resource management. In this step, resources, which are defined in the first step, are assigned to the specific activities in the project schedule. At that step, we also determine the required number resources. However, multiple sources may be assigned to a specific activity, in addition to that, even the requirement for a specific resource may be different for each activity. For instance, some activities in the initial steps may need fewer workers, while the demand for workers may increase in the later stages. Moreover, a multi project environment can increase the complexity of resource allocation process since projects compete for scarce resources. Therefore, in this step of resource management, we try to optimize the utilization of these resources while we assign them to various project activities. <br/>In resource allocation step, we can create an allocation table for both the overall project or a specific<br/>activity. However, it is highly recommended to create an overall project resource allocation table to see<br/>the big picture. The answer is E."

Hence, a good project manager must always be ready to adjust the resources with respect to the possible changes.<br/>• Availability of Resources: Having multiple projects that share the same resources, broken machines, or sick workers force a project manager to monitor the resources all the time since the availability of resources can suddenly change.<br/>• Activity Predecessors: A project manager must pay great attention to the activity predecessors while allocating the resources. In most cases, there exist some activities in the project which cannot be started before some other activities are completed. In such cases, the resources to be used in these activities do not need to be prepared in advance.<br/>• Changes in Priorities: Changes in the priorities among the projects is a common problem for a company if multiple projects run at the same time. In this situation, the resources, which a project manager has already allocated, may be needed by the other project that has a high priority for the company."

In order to evaluate the resource<br/>management software, the following criteria can be used. <br/>• <strong>User Interface (UI):</strong> Does the design of the software maximize the usability and the user experience? Is the user’s interaction simpler and efficient enough to accomplish the user’s goals? <br/>• <strong>Usability:</strong> Is it easy to use and learn? Are there comprehensive tutorials and training about the software? Do they provide necessary technical support? <br/>• <strong>Features &amp; Functionality:</strong> Do the functions and features of the software meet the demand of the company? How powerful are they? Especially the following features are very important. <br/><strong> - Scheduling and allocation tools:</strong> Is it easy to assigning the resource to the right activities? Does the software provide necessary data for possible allocation strategies? Does it include an auto-scheduling feature?<br/><strong> - Skills tracking:</strong> Does it have a feature to filter workers based on their skills and availability? Is it easy to search by skill? Does it provide you feedback about necessary skills? <br/><strong> - Forecasting:</strong> Does it have a resource forecasting tool to predict the upcoming resource requirements of the company? Does it collect data on sales, schedules, activities, progress of the project, and launches? How long does the forecasting tool cover? <br/>-<strong> Utilization management tools:</strong> Does it provide necessary data about the utilization of the resources? Does it offer you alternative ways of utilizing resources throughout the project lifecycle?<br/><strong> - Reporting:</strong> Does it have a reporting tool? Is it easy to use? Does the reporting tool allow you to extract and present data in charts, tables, and other visualizations? How well does the sharing option of these reports work?<br/>• <strong>Integrations:</strong> Does it work in an integrated and compatible way with other software recently used in the company? Does the data transmission options fit with the available management systems in the company? <br/>• <strong>Price-performance ratio:</strong> Are there any buying options for different requirements when compared with the similar software, how appropriate is the price? Does the price cover possible system upgrades? Is there a time-based usage fee, such as an annual usage fee or annual licensing fee?<br/>The answer is B."

      "E": "Managing Risk"
    },
    "explanation": "The attributes<br/>of the project manager that determine their roles in a project are as follows:<br/>1. Powerful communication skills: A PM must be a good communicator so that he/<br/>she can connect with people either in the project team or other at all levels. The PM<br/>must clarify the goal of the project together with the responsibilities and tasks of team<br/>members, expectations and feedback.<br/>2. Proficient technical skills: There are some<br/>crucial project management software and<br/>related programs to achieve the project<br/>goals. Thus, an effective PM must have<br/>strong technical knowledge to understand<br/>the technical aspects. Moreover, technical<br/>as well as theoretical knowledge can greatly<br/>help the manager take strategic initiative<br/>when needed.<br/>3. Managing resources: This may also be<br/>called management skills. In general, this<br/>may be either cost management or task<br/>management. However, those are not<br/>the only two management elements. As<br/>time, money, people, equipment, etc. are<br/>the resources to be managed, an effective<br/>manager should be good at managing<br/>resources.<br/>4. Good decision maker: Since there are always<br/>decisions to be made, the project manager<br/>should be a very good decision maker.<br/>These decisions can be instantaneous, as<br/>well as time-consuming decisions.<br/>5. Managing Risk: Whether the project<br/>is small or large, the risk is inherent.<br/>Therefore, identifying, evaluating, and<br/>controlling risk before carrying out the<br/>project is the risk management attribute<br/>that the project manager must possess in<br/>order to be effective.<br/>6. Perfect visionary: The project manager<br/>needs to be able to see the few steps ahead<br/>and estimate the results of the existing<br/>actions. A visionary project manager<br/>can take the team members in the right<br/>direction and easily adapt to changes on<br/>their way.<br/>7. Negotiating skills: For example, as a<br/>project manager, you will receive requests<br/>from stakeholders that may possibly affect<br/>the scope of a project. You’ll have to push<br/>them back, but diplomatically, all interested<br/>parties think they get what they want. Then<br/>there are inevitable conflicts that will arise<br/>between team members or other people<br/>involved in the project. If you are good at<br/>negotiation, you can resolve these disputes<br/>before threatening and failing the project.<br/>8. Team building: The project manager<br/>cannot execute a project alone. Therefore,<br/>the project manager should form a team to<br/>work with before continuing the project.<br/>Project managers need to manage the team<br/>operationally as well as leading a team from a strategic perspective. We will give details regarding<br/>this attribute in the following sections.<br/>9. Leadership: This attribute is a vogue word for project management world. The concepts of manager<br/>and leader are all mentioned together. In general, leadership is the top first attribute of a project<br/>manager, but we mentioned it last because we believe that this should be given in detail. Thus, the<br/>following section will focus on the managing versus leading a project topic."

    "explanation": "In project management, effective team leaders can usually create a partnership approach between themselves and their teams. The idea of leadership as a partnership is crucial for project management because it emphasizes the importance of all leaders ultimately dependent on their teams to achieve their project objectives. Four things are required to develop the idea of partnership between the project manager and the team (Pinto, 2016, p118):<br/>1. Exchange of purpose: Partnerships require that every worker be responsible for defining theproject’s vision and goals. A steady dialogue between the project manager and team members can create a consistent and widely shared vision.<br/>2. A right to say no: It is critical that all members of the project team feel they have the ability to disagree and to offer contrary positions. Supporting people’s right to voice their disagreements is a cornerstone of a partnership. Losing arguments is acceptable; losing the right to disagree is not.<br/>3. Joint accountability: In a partnership, each member of the project team is responsible for the project’s outcomes and the current situation, whether it is positive or shows evidence of problems.The project is shared among multiple participants and the results of the project are also shared.<br/>4. Absolute honesty: Partnerships demand authenticity. An authentic atmosphere promotes straightforwardness and honesty among all participants. Because we respect each team member’s role on the project, we make an implicit pact that all information, both good and bad, becomes community information. Just as honesty is a cornerstone of successful marriages, it is critical in project team relationships."

    "explanation": "Pros:<br/>• As a PM, there are various industries, companies and consultancy opportunities that you can work. Hence, you can be an IT project manager, a consulting project manager, or even a movie project manager. Thus, you have a chance to experience different environments.<br/>• As your project topic and project teams change, you will always havethe opportunity to learn new things. <br/>• It can be a very valuable job to successfully close a project by thoroughly completing its steps and to see the results achieved by your team.<br/>• You have an influential leadership position that canmake positive change at all levels of an organization.<br/>Cons:<br/>• Sometimes the requirements of a project, the steps to be taken later, and all the resources available to implement the project are vast question marks. A PM needs to develop the ability to act on uncertain conditions and focus on the next step.<br/>• The ability of the project manager to manage team members, resources, and programs is often based on discussion with managers, department managers, and even other project managers. This brings a lot of responsibility but a lack of authority. PMs must have extensive interpersonal skills to deal with this.<br/>• As mentioned under the pros, you may be a PM in an environment different from your occupation or background. You may feel that you are away from your technical discipline. <br/>• Since a project has a start and a finish date, a PM’s job is going to end when the project is completed. Therefore, it may be perceived that you do not have a real job by others.<br/>The answer is C."

    "explanation": "The idea of leadership as a partnership is crucial for project management because it emphasizes the importance of all leaders ultimately dependent on their teams to achieve their project objectives. Four things are required to develop the idea of partnership between the project manager and the team:<br/><strong>1. Exchange of purpose:</strong> Partnerships require that every worker be responsible for defining the project’s vision and goals. A steady dialogue between the project manager and team members can create a consistent and widely shared vision. <br/><strong>2. A right to say no:</strong> It is critical that all members of the project team feel they have the ability to disagree and to offer contrary positions. Supporting people’s right to voice their disagreements is a cornerstone of a partnership. Losing arguments is acceptable; losing the right to disagree is not. <br/><strong>3. Joint accountability:</strong> In a partnership, each member of the project team is responsible for the project’s outcomes and the current situation, whether it is positive or shows evidence of problems. The project is shared among multiple participants and the results of the project are also shared.<br/><strong>4. Absolute honesty:</strong> Partnerships demand authenticity. An authentic atmosphere promotes straightforwardness and honesty among all participants. Because we respect each team member’s role on the project, we make an implicit pact that all information, both good and bad, becomes community information. Just as honesty is a cornerstone of successful marriages, it is critical in project team relationships.<br/>The answer is E."

In this sense, Sundstrom, Meuse and Futrell defined team as “an interdependent collection of individuals who work together towards a common goal and who share responsibility for specific outcomes of their organizations”. Since the project teams work on specific projects, this definition is generally appropriate.<br/>Staffing and building a project team as well as encouraging cross-functional cooperation among team members are not supporting topics in project management but those are the key behavioral skills that PMs face and manage. Staffing and building will be introduced in the following section. A project team consists of team members from different departments of an organization, thus most project teams can be classified as cross-functional teams. The cross-functional team may include team members from the departments of Research and Development (RD), finance, marketing, human factors, etc. and from all levels of the organization. In addition, members may also be from external stakeholders such as suppliers and consultants. Pinto mentioned one project on project teams which has uncovered a set of critical factors that contribute to cross-functional cooperation. The answer is A."

The idea of leadership as a partnership is crucial for project managementbecause it emphasizes the importance of all leaders ultimately dependent on their teams to achieve theirproject objectives. Four things are required to develop the idea of partnership between the project managerand the team (Pinto, 2016, p118):<br/>1. Exchange of purpose: Partnerships require that every worker be responsible for defining theproject’s vision and goals. A steady dialogue between the project manager and team members cancreate a consistent and widely shared vision.2. A right to say no: It is critical that all members of the project team feel they have the ability todisagree and to offer contrary positions. Supporting people’s right to voice their disagreements is acornerstone of a partnership. Losing arguments is acceptable; losing the right to disagree is not.3. Joint accountability: In a partnership, each member of the project team is responsible for theproject’s outcomes and the current situation, whether it is positive or shows evidence of problems.The project is shared among multiple participants and the results of the project are also shared.4. Absolute honesty: Partnerships demand authenticity. An authentic atmosphere promotesstraightforwardness and honesty among all participants. Because we respect each team member’srole on the project, we make an implicit pact that all information, both good and bad, becomescommunity information. Just as honesty is a cornerstone of successful marriages, it is critical inproject team relationships."

This ensures that the disputes between the participants are resolved and the process is carried out correctly. <br/>• Meetings - In the qualitative risk analysis process, the project team can organize risk workshops and meetings to review, evaluate, categorize, and prioritize project risks. <br/>• Risk categorization includes technical, external (suppliers, legal, etc.), and internal (infrastructure, resources, etc.) risk groups. It identifies the areas that may affect the project the most and provides the right risk response plan.<br/>• Risk data quality assessment - If the information collected about the risks is incorrect, biased, or incomplete, the results of the qualitative analysis will not be reliable. Therefore, risk data quality assessment is performed during the qualitative risk analysis process. The source of the data, the accuracy of the data, its relevance to your project, and its specific conditions are evaluated. You may need to collect better quality data if the current data quality is not sufficient to perform a comprehensive analysis. <br/>• Risk probability and impact assessment - As another data analysis technique, risk probability and impact assessment is performed to determine the likelihood of a particular risk occurring in your project. <br/>Assumption analysis is used for quantitative risk analysis.

    },
    "explanation": "There are two basic indicators to evaluate a project in terms of cost and workload. The first one is the cost performance index (CPI) and the other one is the schedule performance index (SPI). These values are positive, and if they equal to one, that means the project in on the way. For example, CPI is equal to one at the status date, that means actual spending has been realized in accordance with the baseline plan. If CPI is less than one, that means there is much spending according to the baseline plan, and vice versa if CPI is greater than one. Similarly, if SPI is equal to one, actual workload has been realized in accordance with the baseline plan by the status date. If SPI is less than one, it means that less work has been done according to the baseline plan (schedule), and vice versa if SPI is greater than one. Shortly, values of CPI and SPI greater than 1.0 indicate that work is ahead of schedule and under budget, respectively. Values less than 1.0 indicate the opposite. In other words, you can think that obtaining less than one for CPI and SPI is not good, and it means more spending, less work. Besides, the greater deviation for CPI and SPI we get, the more discordance between the actual situation at the status date and the baseline plan it means. As a result, these two values are the most important indicators that reveal the performance of the project. In order to calculate these two performance indicators, some other values should be calculated firstly. They are given in the following entries based on the Project Management book written by Burke. The answer is B."

Therefore, the project manager has to control whether jobs are performed according to their calendar after the project starts. Additionally, this control should be done in terms of cost and schedule (workload). If there are deviations according to the baseline plan such as exceeding budget or tardiness for some jobs, corrective actions should be taken immediately."
