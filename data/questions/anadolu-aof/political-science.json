The ‘forces of production’ at the particular stage of historical development are matched by definite ‘relations of production’ that characterize the society. The relations of production taken together constitute the economic foundation (base) of the society. The legal and political institutions (super structure) stand on this economic structure. In the Marxian approach to political analysis, politics is thus conceived in terms of the specific articulation of class struggles. Though other types of struggles are not ignored, class conflict is the core of the Marxist view of politics."

    "explanation": "The parliamentary system of government was created in the United Kingdom. All similar parliamentary governments are referred to as Westminster Parliamentary systems. In such systems the citizens directly elect members of the legislative body. The elected members of the parliament then choose from among the leading political party who will be the Prime Minister with executive functions. Unlike in the United States, where the constitution is a permanent document stating the rules for government, the UK parliamentary system does not have a codified constitution. Its rules for government are included in various documents and in the decisions by courts of law. In the Westminster parliamentary system in the United Kingdom, if Parliament loses confidence in the Prime Minister, it can cast a vote of “no confidence” and replace him or her"

The more sophisticated a democracy becomes, the more difficulty its citizens face to understand the many political issues. This can lead to indifference or even to a refusal to participate. On the other hand it can open political decision making to a public that is ill-informed and likely to support poor policy."

Members usually fund mass parties (Saribay, 2016; Lawson 2003).<br/>Political parties differ greatly. In the United States, political parties tend to be open and<br/>inclusive. Anyone can join any party. The two main political parties in the United States are the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Members in either party can agree or disagree with the party opinion of any issues. This freedom to disagree with the party message in the United States is clear when we analyze the candidates nominated by each party. Though Republicans are considered conservative and Democrats are considered liberal, candidates’ views on any particular issue can range from conservative to liberal and anywhere in between (Grigsby, 2009; Katz and Mair, 1995).<br/>Political parties in other types of democracies differ from the U.S. model.

    "explanation": "Researchers have found that the main way that people get information about political and social issues is the media. Therefore, the media has an important role in shaping public opinion. Studies have shown the more the media covers an issue the more important it seems to the individual. Additionally, how an issue is covered also gives people ideas for how they should feel about the issue. This is known as framing. For example, if a story is written with a negative feel or the focus is on the problems of an issue, the public is more likely to have a negative feeling about the issue"
