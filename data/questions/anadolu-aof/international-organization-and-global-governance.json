    },
    "explanation": "Although liberalism does not assume that war is illusory, at least it defines the<br/>nature of international relations as a sequence of cooperation and conflict, not only as a conflictual process as Realists do. As such, in contrast to the realist perspective, liberalism takes a different stance on the role of IOs in world affairs. Since liberalism underlines the importance of cooperation between states, naturally this approach attributes a greater prominence to international organizations and considers them as essential actors of International Relations. In that respect, IOs are regarded as the “early institutions of world government.” IOs serve as a platform for states to cooperate and they provide with states and other non-state actors a formal set of rules that are necessary for managing international affairs. In this regard, IOs serve to the common good of all participating states rather than to the interests of a single most powerful state. It is believed that states choose to cooperate through international organizations, because they help to reduce the costs of managing international affairs for nation states. Therefore, states most of the time prefer to act in<br/>line with the institutional structure of international organizations."

As is also understood from the information given, the correct answer is A. In order to deepen the cooperation, the Nordic Council of Ministers was created in 1971 to complement the Council as well as a Secretariat was set up. Moreover, the organization enlarged: in 1955 Finland, in 1970 the Faroe Islands and Åland, and in 1984 Greenland joined the organization. The Council of Ministers consists of sub-groups focusing on different issue areas, including labor, sustainable growth, equality, culture, and environment.\n The UN General Assembly is an excellent example of an interstate organ where each member state has one vote. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe illustrates a parliamentary organ, which is composed of 324 parliamentarians from 47 member states.\n Moreover, some IOs have judicial bodies in order to settle the disputes between the members such as the International Court of Justice, the principal judicial organ of the UN, or to act as the ‘court of last resort’ such as the European Court of Human Rights."

    "explanation": "International Organizations (IOs) mainly provide a common platform for members to meet, deliberate, find solutions to their common problems, resolve their disputes, and widen their collaboration.\n<br/>These are: articulation and aggregation, norm-setting, recruitment, socialization, rulemaking, rule application, rule adjudication, information, and operation.\n<br/>The first main function of IOs is articulation and aggregation. This refers to the ability of IOs to bring together unions or organizations that focus on similar issues.\n<br/>The second significant function of IOs is norm-setting. International organizations greatly contribute to the creation of new norms. They also encourage states to involve in norm-setting processes. Throughout the 20th century, IOs played key roles in the development of new international norms especially on human rights, slavery, global economy, and environment.\n<br/>The third function of IOs is recruitment. This refers to their organizational capacity to allow new members to become a member of the international community with full rights.\n<br/>The fourth main function of IOs is socialization. In general, socialization can be considered as a learning process of states about values. INGOs can enable people who share the same beliefs to get socialized at the international level.\n<br/>Other three significant functions of IOs are rule-making, rule application, and rule adjudication. Although these kind of functions are more associated with states, IOs also fulfil such roles in the international system. These functions of IOs are particularly important because the absence of a central authority makes it difficult to produce common rules in international politics.\n<br/>Another main function of international organizations is concerned with information and operation. IOs provide mechanisms for the exchange of information among states. Through new information technologies and regular meetings, they help different actors discuss common problems, and as such they not onlyfoster information but also decrease the transaction costs. IOs also fulfil operational roles especially in the international banking system and aid mechanisms for the developing countries. As they are established mostly in issue-specific areas, NGOs provide expertise and technical assistance thanks to their organizational structure.\n<br/>As is also understood from the information given, the correct answer is E. “Articulation and Aggregation”, “Norm-setting”, “Recruitment” and “Socialization” are among the functions of international organizations. The other functions of international organizations which do not take place in the options are “Rule Application” and “Rule Adjudication”."

    "explanation": "The main theoretical classification on the role of international relations is structured around: traditional realism, liberalism, Marxism along with constructivism, feminism, the green theory, and other integration theories.\n Integration is a process “whereby political actors in several, distinct national settings are persuaded to shift their loyalties, expectations and political activities toward new center, whose institutions possess or demand jurisdiction over pre-existing national states”. The theoretical approaches dealing with integration focus on the development of certain policies as well as institutional and governance structures that exist above and/or beyond the nation-state level.\n <strong>Functionalism</strong> is an integration theory concerning the development, role, and functioning of IOs. David Mitrany, the founding father of the functionalist theory, justifies the establishment of IOs based on their social, economic, political, and other related functions that are deemed essential for promoting the interests of nation states. The functions of IOs provide the basis for the development of common interests and cooperation among nation-states. As is also understood from the information given, the correct answer is A.\n Other integration theories are federalism, neofunctionalism, intergovernmentalism / liberal-intergovernmentalism.\n <strong>Federalism</strong> as an integration theory gained prominence in the post-Second World War period. Following the War, the idea of establishing a supranational political union in Europe dominated the agenda of West European nations. The rationale behind this initiative was to prevent any future wars and establish a lasting peace in Europe.\n <strong>Neofunctionalism</strong>, a theory of regional integration, was developed in the 1960s and 1970s as a “moderate conceptual tool” for assessing the European integration process. Neofunctionalism expands the notions of functionalism by combining the “functionalist mechanisms” with “federalist goals,” devoting extensive self-sufficiency to “supranational” institutions.\n During the political stalemate in the 1960s, neofunctionalism was highly criticized by the intergovernmentalist approach. In contrast to neofunctionalists’ stress on the role of supranational decision-making bodies in the institutional structure of IOs, prominent scholars of intergovernmentalism such as Stanley Hoffmann point to the decisive role of national/domestic politics for the integration process (Hoffmann, 1966). <strong>Intergovernmentalism and liberal intergovernmentalism</strong> consider the formation of IOs as a process of inter-state bargaining process wherein socioeconomic interests, the positions of political elite, and ideology matter to a great extent.\n The definitions of the other international theories are as follows:\n <strong>Realism</strong> is one of the major theories of international relations. The state-centric approach of realism is accepted as its distinctive trait, since the state is theoretically acknowledged as the main actor in international relations who follows its own interests and compete for power in the international system. Realism considers the concept of power as the ability to change and adjust the behavior of others in an anticipated way. Presuming that the state behavior is mainly shaped by the dynamics of power and security in international relations, it is hypothesized that states can maximize their self-interests by providing their own security and preserving (and even increasing) their own power.\n In its debate on international affairs, <strong>liberalism</strong> focuses on the individual rather than on the state and draws its basic ethical tenets from the value of the human being. Based on the works of Adam Smith such as The Wealth of Nations and of John Locke such as The Essay Concerning Human Understanding, the liberal approach acknowledges the possibility of establishing cooperative relations between not only individuals but also nation states. Accordingly, nation states can build peaceful interstate relations especially through such issue areas as economics and trade. Although liberalism does not assume that war is illusory, at least it defines the nature of international relations as a sequence of cooperation and conflict, not only as a conflictual process as Realists do.\n Marxism along with constructivism, feminism, the green theory are critical IR theories.\n The Marxist approach contributes to the understanding of international relations and the role of IOs by critically assessing realism and liberalism, which are the dominant theoretical approaches to international relations. <strong>Marxism</strong> primarily focuses on the role of economic power in international affairs. Marxism criticizes capitalism as the main mode of production on the grounds that it causes inequalities among nation states and thus destabilizes the world order and increases the possibility of a conflict among states. Marxism regards IOs as tools and/or influence mechanisms of capitalism that widen the gap between the developed nations and the developing/ underdeveloped nations.\n <strong>Constructivism</strong> is one of the recent prominent theories of International Relations. The constructivist approach focuses on the epistemology and sociology of knowledge as well as the agentstructure debate. The approach perceives the current world structure through the lens of “social construction of power politics”. Constructivism argues that IOs contribute to bilateral and multilateral cooperation among nation states, despite the fact that their material interests and political power may not be maximized through this cooperation.\n As one of the critical theories of international relations, feminism focuses on the role of gender and gender politics in international affairs. <strong>Feminism </strong>discusses women’s possible role in, and contribution to, the decision-making and policy-making processes within IOs with regard to important issues of international affairs and global governance.\n <strong>Green Theory</strong>: Today’s world is facing a rapid process of globalization that has produced complex and interdependent structures. These complex structures include economic, political, social as well as ecological issue areas where a good global governance has become a necessity. The environmental issues are no longer considered within the scope of nation states. Rather, these issues expanded and many new actors participated in managing them, including “networks of experts, environmentalist organizations and multinational corporations as well as new agencies set up by governments”. This theoretical approach suggests that today IOs play a significant role in the decision-making mechanisms that deal with environmental issues and develop “legally binding” policies negotiated and agreed upon by nation states and non-state entities. In fact, IOs help to strengthen the idea of global governance on environmental issues by reconciling processes of rule-making and rule implementation that takes place at different levels of governance, i.e. sub-national, national, supranational, and international."

    "explanation": "The idea of global governance is based on the formation of an international society, which consists of nation states that aim at forming global institutions and following global practices. The process of globalization of an international society includes reflective universalism that embodies state-society relations around the world. These interactions involve not only the formation of universal values and norms, but also common practices aiming at creating a peaceful world order. Universalism is a theme prominently associated with the modern world-system. It is in many ways one of its boasts. Universalism means in general the priority to general rules applying equally to all persons, and therefore the rejection of particularistic preferences in most spheres. The League of Nations was the first attempt at putting the idea of universalism into action with regard to peace and international security. The United Nations is the second international organizations with universal values. For several reasons, the UN is considered a more effective organization than its predecessor, the League of Nations. The idea of universalism embedded in the UN’s structure and autonomy is reflected in many ways. As is also understood from the information given, the correct answer is A.\n “The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)”, “Warsaw Pact” and “The European Union” are regional cooperations. There is a growing trend of regional groupings and formal institutional structures in today’s world affairs. The initial regionalist developments as a formal institutional cooperation in international relations came into existence in peace and security issues. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact as alliances exemplify the establishment of a permanent organizational structure to deal with regional security challenges. Besides, we observe the establishment of regional economic, social, and political organizations, especially in Europe, following the end of the Second World War. The European Coal and Steel Community, which subsequently evolved into the European Economic Community, and the European Union are the most representative initiatives in regionalization."

Marxism regards IOs as tools of powerful developed states to protect<br/>their own benefits at the expense of underdeveloped or developing states. For constructivism, IOs are beneficial actors for nation states to build cooperative relations based on their willful stance rather than rational behavior. Feminism focuses on the role of IOs through the lens of gender and gender politics in international affairs. The Green theory attributes a great importance to IOs since they form and protect international norms and rules on environmental issues by creating close networks of organizations, environmentalist experts, and multinational corporations as well as agencies. Federalism as an integration theory sees the IOs as central decision-making bodies that have control over the ways in which means of power are used for common political problems of nation states. Functionalism and neofunctionalism underline the functional value of IOs for nation-states. In that respect, this approach finds a ground for IOs in international affairs since they help to develop common interests and cooperative relations among individual member states.

Related to this, collective security opposes the alliance-building policy, and it rather prescribes a universal alliance. \n<br/>Collective security prescribes a partially centralized system for the management of power. Although, states still possess the means of power, resort to force is regulated by a central agency, which is a general international organization such as the League of Nations or the United Nations. Also, in this agenda, aggression would be deterred not by an equilibrium of power but by a preponderance. As such, collective security holds that most, if not all, states must remain committed to the system to deter the potential aggressor, and, when needed, participate in collective actions to punish the aggressor. In addition, although collective security prescribes imposing on the aggressor moral, diplomatic, and economic sanctions, its credibility as a deterrent relies ultimately on military sanction. Therefore, collective security is a hard approach to world order.

According to the collective security scheme, an attack in the system against any state will trigger the combined resistance of all other states. It is, in other words, a scheme of ‘<strong>all against one</strong>;’ a scheme for creating a preponderance of power against the aggressor. Nevertheless, the existing security environment may not be conducive to follow such a principle in the international system at least for two reasons: the thermonuclear revolution and the grouping of states along ideological lines."

Meyer urged that peace-through-power reasoning is wrong and that the internationalist approach, which fails to transform this reasoning, should be discarded.

    "explanation": "Collective security prescribes a partially centralized system for the management of power. Although, states still possess the means of power, resort to force is regulated by a central agency, which is a general international organization such as the League of Nations or the United Nations. Second, in this agenda, aggression would be deterred not by an equilibrium of power but by a preponderance. As such, collective security holds that most, if not all, states must remain committed to the system to deter the potential aggressor, and, when needed, participate in collective actions to punish the aggressor. Third, although collective security prescribes imposing on the aggressor moral, diplomatic, and economic sanctions, its credibility as a deterrent relies ultimately on military sanction. Fourth, collective security is a “one for all, all for one” scheme in that states are believed to be committed to deter and punish the aggressor, regardless of their own identities and the aggressor’s identity; put differently, states are supposed not to discriminate between friends and foes. Finally, related to the fourth point, collective security opposes the alliance-building policy, and it rather prescribes a universal alliance. The correct option is E."

    "explanation": "In fact, looking from a broader historical perspective, Reves thought that war has occurred wherever and whenever political units of equal sovereignty have faced each other. The solution to the problem of war, then, would be “integrating the warring units into a higher sovereignty.” This higher sovereignty, or world government, would be provided with legislative, judicial, and executive powers, as the result being “a legal order within which all peoples may enjoy equal security, equal obligation and equal rights under law.” Reves believed that if such a higher authority proves impossible to be created by the consent of nation states, conquest would be permissible. “If we cannot attain to universalism and create union by common consent and democratic methods as a result of rational thinking,” he concluded, “then rather than retard the process, let us precipitate unification by conquest” (Reves, 1945: 122, 125, 269)."

It is also in direct confrontation with a liberal pragmatic way of establishing the desired order through pluralistic means by a slow process.

      "A": "The precise objectives of balance of power system have been agreed on by different scholars.",
      "B": "The classical balance system of the earlier centuries has been modified by the foundation of international organizations and alliances.",

      "E": "Scholars have agreed on approximate equilibrium of power would achieve statesmen’s objectives in the system."
    },
    "explanation": "There are two ideas on the balance of power as a system that deserve attention. First, the balance<br/>of power is a “fallback system” of international relations; in a multistate system, unless analternate system is established for the management of power, it is natural for states to take care of their own security. Put differently, “the balance system is the natural international system in the sense that it does not have to be contrived. In the absence of a different system, states fall back on this one” (Claude, 1990: 35). Secondly, “the contemporary balance of power system is by no means a mere duplicate of systems which have existed in the past” (Claude, 1962: 281). The classical balance system of the earlier centuries has been modified by two major developments in this century; first, the establishment of general international organizations and, second, by institutionalized alliances such as NATO. Then, the system that we have had for the management of power since the establishment of the League of Nations may be called a “modified balance of power system.”\n<br/>The precise objectives of balance of power system have been a controversy among the scholars of international relations. Objectives of (or benefits of, or the results to be expected from) a successfully operating balance of power system have been argued to be either peace, order, stability, moderation, preserving the independence of states, preserving the integrity of the multistate system, or some combination of these.\n<br/>Some scholars, however, have thought that not an equilibrium but a preponderance of power would achieve statesmen’s objectives in the system."

It rejects the idea that world politics is destined to be dominated by powerful states whereas international institutions and global governance are without any power that may effect change in the system.

In such a regime, a “checks and balances system” does not exist that may limit and control the power of the government. Liberal regimes, however, strive to create a democratic, open, and pluralistic society and to manage differing interests in the society like a neutral arbiter. In a liberal regime, the domestic political power is shared among several non-sovereign institutions. For most liberals, the state reflects the concerns and interests of various interest groups (pressure groups) such as the bureaucracy, the military, political parties, and other powerful elites that attempt to improve their own interests in the society. In other words, the liberal state does not mirror the interests of only one elite group or the dominant social class; it rather acts as the fair and impartial mediator between different interest groups. As such, political power is diffused among a range of institutions and a variety of actors in the society. Choice (a) is the correct answer."

    },
    "explanation": "The so-called ‘neo-neo’ debate between neorealism and neoliberalism forms one of the core discussions in the study of International Relations. Although they share some assumptions, neorealism and neoliberalism differ in several respects. First, both approaches assume that international system is “anarchic.” However, while neorealists claim that foreign policy is constrained by anarchy, neoliberals argue that international regimes, globalization, and international interdependence are important tools for managing the relations between international actors. Second, neorealists believe that international cooperation depends on the will and power of nation states; from this perspective, it is difficult to achieve and maintain international cooperation mainly because states strive to achieve their own interests. On the other hand, neoliberals hold that if states have mutual interests in a given issue area of international relations, international cooperation can be achieved in that issue area. Third, neorealists emphasize the importance of relative gains (zero-sum game) in international politics. Neoliberals, however, consider that international actors have common interests so that they can cooperate in a given issue area and maximize their absolute gains (non-zero-sum). Eventually all states can benefit from this cooperation. Fourth, neorealists claim that the primary objective of states is survival in the “anarchical international system,” where they are preoccupied with matters related to national security and relative power gains. On the other hand, neoliberals attach greater importance to sustainable development, economic welfare, and non-security issue areas such as international environmental problems. Fifth, neorealists argue that international institutions and regimes do not affect the state behavior. In a similar vein, regimes do not have a constraining impact on the anarchical nature of the system. Neoliberals, on the other hand, argue that international institutions and regimes are influential in shaping and structuring international relations, because they facilitate cooperation among states.

Second, international regime theories focus on specific issue areas from climate change to peacekeeping, but it excludes complex international organizations.

Therefore, international regimes do not look for links between unrelated issue areas in international politics.

Cognitivists argue that international regimes are basically social entities. Discourses, identities, beliefs, and values are crucial factors in their formation. In return, discourses, identities, beliefs, and values themselves are also influenced by international regimes. Weak cognitivists are more concerned with the impact of new knowledge on decision-makers’ perceptions of their interests. Ideas, learning, and epistemic communities play significant roles in agenda-setting and regime formation. They contribute to the mainstream regime analysis by supplying a theory of interest change. Strong cognitivists criticize the rationalist assumptions of realism and neoliberalism. For example, Wendt points out the “agent-structure problem” (Wendt, 1987) that refers to the question of how institutions shape the identities of their <br/>members and define actors’ interests. Other strong cognitivists such as Kratochwil and Ruggie stress the importance of “intersubjective meanings and shared understandings” in the regime analysis (Krathocwil and Ruggie, 1986: 765). A rulegoverned international society leads to specific norms and rules that produce regimes. Robert Cox, on the other hand, states that historical and hegemonic structure shapes the formation of international regimes (1986). Finally, regimes are socially-constructed conceptual creations that can be analyzed through inter-subjectivity, discourses, and interpretative techniques rather than empirical methods (Young, 1998).

Therefore, each of these units represented a political entity.\n<br/>• Third, each sovereign who represented a state was accepted as equal, regardless of the size of lands they ruled or the nobility o which they belonged.\n<br/>• Fourth, though no international organization emerged as a body until the late 19th century, the way in which these peace accords were made initialized a method that enabled states to communicate collectively through diplomatic instruments. Thus, it is possible to assert that the Peace of Westphalia laid the foundations of collective diplomacy and established the basis of the Congress System that would help institutionalize the international environment in the following centuries."

The congress aimed to optimize the European political map and the political system to satisfy the interests of every state represented."

      "D": "The Concert encouraged its members to create further organizations.",
      "E": "It failed to prevent the confrontations of Europeans with non-European powers"
    },
    "explanation": "The Concert of Europe and its congress diplomacy had both positive and negative outcomes by the end of the 19th century:\n • The congress system proved to be the best mechanism for mediation and arbitration among European powers. Besides, meeting periodically at the congresses contributed to the construction of a collective identity among Europeans, because the common diplomatic language and codes created shared understandings among states. However, the system was confined to Europe. NonEuropeans were neither familiar with the congress diplomacy nor shared a common understanding of diplomacy and customs.\n • The Concert contributed to the cooperation among European states for maintaining peace as well as the governance of the system. However, it did not produce permanent international bodies for resolving the disputes. Nor did it contribute to the institutionalization of international regulations and norms by way of codifying them into international law. The Concert never encouraged its members to create further organizations. As such, it was only an instrument of collective diplomacy, not an organizational body to regulate the international system. Its structure was determined by the great powers which produced rival blocks by the end of the century.\n • In European politics the congress system served as a tool of peacebuilding after the armed conflicts. However, it failed to prevent the confrontations of Europeans with non-European powers as the cases of US-Spanish War of 1898 and the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 illustrated.\n • Although the congress system was the primary tool of great power diplomacy, the outcome of the congresses never surpassed the will and interests of their organizers. In other words, the Concert was designed to favor the great powers and contribute to their common interests. Probably, this is the most negative legacy of the Concert for future international organizations, because it undermined the principle of sovereign equality."

After the US rejection of the League of Nations, the Council was dominated by European powers.

After the four-year fighting, it was thought that states would prefer diplomatic rather than military options. In this regard, the League was considered a platform where multilateral diplomacy could function.\n The primary problem of the League was the assumed equality among its members. As it was a design of the victorious states of World War I, the US, Britain, France, Japan, and Italy were given permanent membership in the Council. \n The weak cohesion among the great powers was one of The League's major weaknesses.\n The League did not fairly represent the political and geographical structure of the world.\n Probably the most significant weakness of the League was the lack of credible instruments at its disposal to enforce its own decisions."

      "D": "The admission and expulsion of members to the League of Nations were determined by the Council.",
      "E": "The USA was one of the founding states of the League of Nations."
    },
    "explanation": "Including the victorious allies and neutral countries, 44 states initially became the original members of the League. The number of the League’s member states rapidly increased, and 63 countries became member states of the League by 1939. Although the idea of a permanent international organization for maintaining peace was championed by US President Wilson, the US officially never joined the organization, because the US Senate rejected the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations. The states that were later admitted to the League included Bulgaria and Austria in 1920, Hungary and Romania in 1922, Germany in 1926, Turkey in 1932, and the USSR in 1934. However, some states withdrew from the League’s membership such as Brazil in 1926, Japan in 1933, Germany in 1933, and Italy in 1937. The main organs of the League of Nations were the Assembly, the Council, and the Secretariat. The Assembly was one of the principal bodies of the League. It was composed of one to three representatives from each member state, and therefore reflected the universal characteristic of the League. The Council was designed to be the other central body of the League of Nations. It was primarily responsible for the maintenance of peace. The agenda of the Council covered various topics from frontier adjustments or border disputes that emanated from the inconsistent peace treaties to the governments’ unfair treatment of refugees and minorities, from the administration of specific areas and settlements given to the League to the mediation of disputes among states. The Council held regular meetings every three months and, if necessary, could hold extraordinary sessions. The Council had four permanent members- namely, England, France, Japan, and Italy- and three non-permanent members who were selected by the Assembly for a three-year term. The initial organization of the Council showed that the great powers hoped to protect their privileged positions over other states. Although the Council appeared to be the principal organ to deal with urgent international problems, the Assembly had important powers too. It was the sole authority over the budget of the League. It had authority to decide on the admission and expulsion of a member as well as the revision of treaties. The Secretariat consisted of a Secretary-General and staff who were responsible for the administrative affairs of the organization. This body represented the organizational structure of the League and contributed to the cooperation and collaboration among its various departments. The staff included members from all parts of the world. The staff members of the Secretariat were responsible to the SecretaryGeneral and to the organization as a whole. They were expected to serve independently of their own governments (Bennett, 2010: 33). As such, the Secretariat represented also the universal identity of the League. Throughout its history, the League had three Secretaries-General: Sir Eric James Drummond from Britain (1919-1933), Joseph Avenol from France (1933-1940), and Séan Lester from Ireland (1940-1946).

    "explanation": "During the early 1920s, the League proved its potential with regard to preventing wars. The League’s Council was instrumental in the settlement of the border dispute between Germany and Poland in Upper Silesia in 1922, the Corfu incident between Italy and Greece in 1923, the border clashes between Greece-Bulgaria in 1925, and the Mosul question between Great Britain and Turkey. However, from the early 1930s on, the League began to face significant challenges that actually tested its capacity for maintaining the peace of the Versailles Treaty. The first major crisis was the Japanese occupation of the Chinese territory of Manchuria in September 1931. The Manchuria crisis showed all weaknesses of the League’s Covenant. Another challenge that the League faced during the 1930s was the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (Abyssinia) in 1935. Italy had expansionist ambitions in Somali and Eritrea in the early 1930s. After a series of border clashes, Ethiopian King Haile Selassie wanted to submit the issue to arbitration, but it was refused by Italy. The Ethiopian government brought the issue before the Council. However, the British and French noninterference in the Italian plans in East Africa further helped Mussolini delay the Council’s decision. After the refusal of a final British and French reconciliation effort, Italy began a full-scale invasion of Ethiopia in October 1935. The correct answer is B."

The former, signed on 18 September 1815, was a proclamation of the three East European monarchies, that is, the royal houses of Habsburg, Hohenzollern, and Romanov. The alliance was proposed as a spiritual formation of the three sects of Christianity. The three monarchs would remain united by the bonds of a true fraternity. With the Alliance, all three monarchs accepted each other as equals and brothers. The monarchs promised to rule their subjects based on Christian values such as charity, justice, and peace as well as to stay united in helping each other to fulfill the role given to them by their God. Under such an agreement, the parties accepted to employ any effective measure toward helping one another. The content of the Holy Alliance was an explicit manifesto for the legitimacy of the absolute monarchy’s sovereignty over the people who had recently experienced wthe French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Almost all European powers were forced to muster huge armies to fight against the citizen army of the French Republic and then Napoleon’s French Empire. Napoleonic Wars. As such, the rules of the Holy Alliance provided the basis on which the new peace in Europe would be established. However, Britain also decided to join the alliance. As a result, the treaty establishing the Quadruple Alliance was signed on 20 November 1815. The correct answer is E."

First, European traditions and experience in international law and organization since the 16th century had a significant impact on the creation of an international organization in the 20th century. Second, the UN also evolved out of the Concert of Europe that was created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. On the one hand, the Concert of Europe was dominated by the great powers, which acted as the guardians of the modern state system (Alger, 1995: 4). On the other hand, meeting more than 30 times between 1815 and 1878 to settle common issues and coordinate their actions, these same powers had also set practices and principles such as multilateral consultation, collective security, and special status for powerful countries that are still influential in the UN system today (Mingst and Karns, 2012:19). Third, the origins of the UN system can be also traced to The Hague Conferences, a pair of international meetings that were held in 1899 and 1907. Finally, the League of Nations, established after the end of World War I, had a huge impact on the creation of the UN."

Subsequently, the Commission for Social Development submitted a draft Declaration on Social Progress and Development, which was adopted by the General Assembly in 1969. This was the first time an international instrument provided clear guidelines for not only social policies but also the integration of economic and social action toward improving the social environment and the well-being of the individual.\n The correct answer is D."

    "explanation": "Health is another major area of global governance. When nations came together to form the UN in 1945, one of the proposals on the agenda was setting up a global health organization. Thus, the Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO) came into force on April 7, 1948. Therefore, we now celebrate April 7 as the world health day. All members of the UN are also members of WHO, which is located in Geneva/ Switzerland. Its primary purpose is to promote global health. WHO is mandated to direct and coordinate authority on international health within the UN system in several ways, including to:\n • provide leadership on matters critical to health and engage in partnerships where joint action is needed,\n • shape the research agenda and stimulate the generation, translation, and dissemination of valuable knowledge,\n • set norms and standards and promote and monitore their implementation,\n • articulate ethical and evidence-based policy options,\n • provide technical support, catalyze change, and build sustainable institutional capacity,\n • monitore the health situation and assess health trends (http://www.who.int).\n WHO has been very successful in controlling malaria and other diseases of the poorer countries. While WHO has undertaken some specific health issue campaigns, its central strategy is based on primary healthcare, including health education, food supply and nutrition, safe water, sanitation, immunization, disease prevention, and the provision of essential drugs. Because of overlapping goals, WHO works closely with other UN bodies such as UNICEF, the Refugee Agency, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and the World Food Programme (WFP) to coordinate their activities. \n The correct answer is B."
