They have focused on the problem of national security and the nation-state. Second, the traditionalist security approaches mostly choose a narrow or mono-sectoral agenda and attach priority to one sector (military), one actor (the state), and one action (the use of force). Finally, the traditionalist security approaches have a statist perspective, which is based on a scientific and objectivist understanding of knowledge. Therefore, the correct option is C."

The critical ISS has developed over the past two decades with new debates on broadening and deepening the scope of security and its referent objects. It adopts diverse sets of theories and some form of post-positivist approach of security that shifts the ontological foundations of understanding of security towards on an emphasis on processes of construction, ideas, and identities. Critical approaches claim the logic of appropriateness in relation to norms and expectations, the logic of exceptionalism in securitization theory, the logic of practicality, the dynamics of discourse, or the potential paths towards security as emancipation.

Different periods of a conflict: Violence escalates and de-escalates and is sometimes interrupted by a period of peace.<br/>2. Changes of intensity: The route of violence, strategies, and availability of weapons can be changed.<br/>3. Paradigmatic changes: Objectives may change. New alliances, fall of the regime, and political shifts can happen<br/>4. Cross-cultural and inter-cultural component: Conflict handling can be affected by high-context and low-context cultural environment (Scherrer, 2002: 13)."

      "E": "Because there is no one institution that would act as a global government and create a just global system, globalization, in fact, functions in a way to increase international anarchy and complexity."
    },
    "explanation": "Globalization and interdependence are the two central components that have changed the nature of power as well as our understanding of security in four major ways. First, the dynamics of international security have changed the power distribution across the board. Nowadays not only the United States but also the Russian Federation, the People’s Republic of China, and the European Union are considered “big powers.” Second, the increase in the volume of global trade, international communication and travel as well as the emergence of the Industry 4.0 have created an integrated global economy and made it necessary to take into account some new actors, means, and perspectives for sustaining and promoting international security. Third, globalization and interdependence may lead to a <strong>butterfly effect </strong>in that local problems may turn into major international threats and challenges that would affect regional and global security. Finally, because there is no one institution that would act as a global government and create a just global system, globalization, in fact, functions in a way to increase international anarchy and complexity. This, in turn, heightens security concerns and calls for a creative problem-solving approach."

It brought together from around the world a variety of scholars with interests in security and with concern about new security studies in the early post-Cold War era. This conference title was used as the title of the book, edited by Keith Krause and Michael C. Williams. In their 1997 book, Critical Security Studies: Concept and Cases, Krause and Williams suggested a broad definition of critical security studies which covered all “new approaches” from Constructivism through Feminism and “Copenhagen School” to Poststructuralism. \n Krause and Williams helped shape critical security studies as a pluralistic field. In addition, they pose such questions to open a broad and complex agenda for security studies. Questioning the referent object of security, ‘who or what is to be secured’, Krause and Williams challenged the traditional state-centric understanding of security and instead put forward the individual as the object of security.\n The term Critical Security Studies is also used to refer to the coherent theoretical school created mostly by the endeavor of Professors Ken Booth and Richard Wyn Jones, Andrew Linklater and their colleagues from the Aberystwyth University. Booth and Wyn Jones developed a brand of ‘Critical Security Studies’ that challenged the definition of security in terms of military threats to the state, and instead linked the study of security to human emancipation.\n Critical Security Studies contributes to security studies by broadening and deepening the concept of security.

As to this concept, there are two main approaches to the security: state-centric security (the state is the referent object) and human-centric approach (human is the referent object). Traditional Security Studies: It refers to Realist, Liberal, Peace Studies and Strategic Studies perspectives in the study of security. All of them prioritize the state as the referent object of security and focus on military threats to the security of the state. Broadening: The broadening security agenda refers to Barry Buzan’s sectoral analysis that the security agenda includes not only military sector issues but also political, economic, societal and environmental issues. Deepening: The state is not only the referent object of security but it also includes human individuals, institutions and groups. Positivism: It claims that social sciences can be built upon the same model as natural sciences. Scientific principles such as objectivity, verification/falsification, and generalization can adapt to the study of society. Post-Positivism: It rejects the idea that it is possible to analyze the natural world and the social world in the same way. There is no objective view (Peoples and Vaughan-Williams, 2010:4)"

In other words, if the threat of an attack in imminent, does this justify the state to use force preemptively? This issue, which in the literature of International Relations is known as “<strong>preemptive strike</strong>” or “<strong>preventive strike</strong>,” is still controversial (Bellier, 2006); however, the actual law (with the exception of recent grave situations such as terrorism) is in conformity with the approach that the UN Charter should be interpreted rather narrowly.

    "explanation": "When states attempt to balance threats by an increase of their national capabilities, this is called internal balancing. Alternatively, when they try to balance against a prevailing threat by the establishment of informal or formal alliances with other states, this is known as external balancing (Grieco, 1997: 160).\n Through internal and external efforts, a state can either increase its own capacity or impair that of its rival. While the former is called positive balancing, the latter is negative balancing (Steff and Khoo, 2014: 2227-228). One can make<br/>another distinction between hard balancing and soft balancing. States use mainly their military and economic capacities in hard balancing, whereas soft balancing suggests the use of diplomatic and cultural means, which are the soft power resources (Fortmann, Paul and Wirtz, 2004: 362-365; Paul, 2004: 3; Pape, 2005: 9-10)."

    "explanation": "An alignment is considered as any general commitment between states in order to achieve mutual security goals. Its objectives are cooperation and collaboration that are broad and vague rather than narrow and explicit (Krause and Singer, 2001: 16; Snyder, 1990: 105). A coalition is characterized by the commitment of two or more states to coordinate their behavior and policies in order to perform particular functions or pursue specific goals. It is often formed during a war (Snyder, 1990: 106).\n Within the balance of power politics, there is another strategy employed by states; bandwagoning. Bandwagoning refers to aligning with or joining the powerful actor toward protecting itself from fear and attack, even if this means insecurity and a certain sacrifice from its independence. In fact one can differentiate between two types of bandwagoning: defensive and offensive. In defensive bandwagoning, which is a form of appeasement, a state aligns with a threatening power to avoid being attacked. Offensive bandwagoning is alignment with a dominant state for the payoffs."

    },
    "explanation": "First of all, an alliance contributes to the balance of power in a given setting. Defensive alliances deter aggressive states from using military force.\n<br/>A formal military alliance such as NATO usually has the purpose of collective defense, where its members pool their capabilities and launch a collective effort to protect one another against a potential outside aggressor.\n<br/>Moreover, alliances help contain potential rivals. For example, the US has benefited from the alliances to contain the Soviet Union (later Russia), China, Iran, and other states that are perceived to be threatening the American political, military, and economic interests. Alliances also provide the means to keep the allies under control through restricting their interaction with potential rivals.\n<br/>Furthermore, alliances enhance the military power of its members. The military strength of an alliance naturally enhances the national power in terms of personnel, military equipment, defense spending, high technology, intelligence sharing, and financial resources.\n<br/>Finally, alliances provide the members with cost-effective options in pursuing national security interests through pooling the military capabilities and sharing the financial burdens. Otherwise, the members would be forced to extensively increase their defense spending and conscript many people that may ultimately strain the workforce. For minor powers, alliances have increasingly become a means not only to acquire essential military benefits but also to achieve various nonmilitary objectives such as diplomatic support, technology transfer, economic aid, and trade privileges."

    "explanation": "In international politics, balance of power refers to a condition in which no one state predominates over others, tending to create general equilibrium and curb the hegemonic ambitions of all states. States may balance in several ways. When states attempt to balance threats by an increase of their national capabilities, this is called internal balancing. Alternatively, when they try to balance against a prevailing threat by the establishment of informal or formal alliances with other states, this is known as external balancing (Grieco, 1997: 160). Through internal and external efforts, a state can either increase its own capacity or impair that of its rival. While the former is called positive balancing, the latter is negative balancing (Steff and Khoo, 2014: 2227-228)."

In fact one can differentiate between two types of bandwagoning: defensive and offensive. In defensive bandwagoning, which is a form of appeasement, a state aligns with a threatening power to avoid being attacked. Offensive bandwagoning is alignment with a dominant state for the payoffs"

The signatories to the defense pact determine the threats in the treaty and concretely prepare to respond to it together. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is the most frequently cited example of a defense pact. The Warsaw Pact was also a defense pact between the Soviet Union and seven other communist states during the Cold War. After it was dissolved in 1991, the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) was established in 1992 as a defense pact among Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan."

In other words, Walt suggest that states balance against threat, rather than against power. As such, Walt presents another theory of alliance: the balance of threat."

    "explanation": "Page 133.<br/>An alliance carries out several functions for its members (Murphy, 2017: 25-26). First of all, an alliance contributes to the balance of power in a given setting. Defensive alliances deter aggressive states from using military force. Many examples of such alliances may be given that prevented fullscale wars between major actors. For example, NATO and the Warsaw Pact as the Cold War alliances deterred the rivals from resorting to military force after World War II. However, rather than using military force, the adversaries may resort to other means of international politics such as diplomatic negotiations, economic sanctions, trade restrictions, financial measures, cyber-attacks, and proxy wars.\n A formal military alliance such as NATO usually has the purpose of collective defense, where its members pool their capabilities and launch a collective effort to protect one another against a potential outside aggressor.\n Moreover, alliances help contain potential rivals. For example, the US has benefited from the alliances to contain the Soviet Union (later Russia), China, Iran, and other states that are perceived to be threatening the American political, military, and economic interests.\n Furthermore, alliances enhance the power of its members. The military strength of an alliance naturally enhances the national power in terms of personnel, military equipment, defense spending, high technology, intelligence sharing, and financial resources. However, the gains of being within an alliance may vary from member to member. Small or minor powers may seek forming an alliance in order to increase their security on the basis of major power guarantees and to protect their territories and populations from possible military threats. However, major or great powers may be interested in forming an alliance with minor powers not to protect their territories and populations but rather to expand their military influence and diplomatic influence over other states or deny such influence to potential rivals.\n Finally, alliances provide the members with cost-effective options in pursuing national security interests through pooling the military capabilities and sharing the financial burdens. Otherwise, the members would be forced to extensively increase their defense spending and conscript many people that may ultimately strain the workforce.\n Therefore, the correct option is E."

For example, Stephen Walt questions the theory of balance of power on the grounds that the threat a state perceives is the most important driving factor for the balancing behavior.

A culture that values violence or war may be given as an example for cultural reasons of terrorism. Social-psychological reasons also help explain political violence. Among these reasons, “intent detection and anger” and “expectation of revenge” stand out. Academic studies show that “intent detection” increases the anger and the aggression has the potential to cause further aggression as long as the anticipation of revenge keeps the negative thoughts in the consciousness (Taylor et al., 2007: 412453).\n Therefore, one can conclude that giving voice to “malevolence” may create a potential enemy. Iran’s labeling the US as “the Great Satan” and Israel as the “Little Satan” is an example of “intent detection and anger.” On the other hand, the US list of rogue states is another example of “intent detection and anger.” Moreover, the violence that continues over a long time may provide future generations with cultural and social-psychological reasons for the continuation of a conflict, as we have observed in the case of the Palestine-Israeli conflict.
