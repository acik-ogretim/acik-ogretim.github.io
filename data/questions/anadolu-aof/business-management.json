    "explanation": "In contrast to the classical management theory’s search for the best way to solve organizational problems, the contingency approach rejects the idea that there is a best way or a solution for all organizational problems. According to the contingency approach, managerial practices are shaped by contingent and situational circumstances. Actually, this approach emphasized an “if-then” relationships. In other words, “if” a contingent variable exists, “then” a manager would most likely to act accordingly. For example, if a manager is responsible for a group of inexperienced subordinates, then, according to the contingency approach, the manager should lead this group in a different way than if the subordinates were experienced. In general, this approach attempts to outline the conditions and situations in which various management tools and techniques have the best chance of success.17 An important advantage of the contingency approach is that it enables managers to analyze specific and situational issues before making their decisions. Basically, organizational structures and control mechanisms managers choose depend on the characteristics of the environment in which the organization operates. According to the contingency approach, the characteristics of the environment directly affect an organization’s ability to obtain resources. It should be noted that how managers design the organizational hierarchy, choose the control mechanism, and lead their employees are contingent on the characteristics of the organizational environment.18"

Today, quantitative approach is mainly represented by management science and operations research. Statistics, linear programming, network analysis, decision trees, and computer simulations are among the quantitative tools and methods adopted by the quantitative management approach.

    },
    "explanation": "The decision-making process discussed above is also known as the <em>rational model of decision making</em>, but this classical model is not the only model put forward to explain managerial decision making. There is the <em>bounded rationality model </em>which challenges the rational model for not being realistic enough and a third model, namely, <em>intuitive decision making</em>, which will be discussed under the title of decision models. The rational model or approach to decision making27 takes its name from its major premise that the decision makers, typically managers, are fully rational. Also known as the classical model of decision making, this model is built on a number of assumptions that constitute rationality. The bounded rationality model is built on the fact that managers, as human beings, are limited by their ability to process information, therefore, they tend to <em>satisfice </em>rather than optimize. <em>Satisficing </em>means, the decision maker settles for the first satisfactory alternative that comes to his or her attention. Bounded rationality is the idea that in decision making, rationality is limited by (a) the information at hand, (b) the cognitive limitations of the human mind, and (c) the finite amount of time to make a decision. When compared with the rational model, another realistic model or approach would be intuitive decision making. Intuition is knowing or understanding something instinctively or subconsciously without reasoning or proof. In this model, decisions are taken through five different aspects of intuition.Starting with experience-based decisions, managers use their past experiences. The second aspect of intuition in decisions are feelings and emotions (affect-initiated decisions). In the third, managers make decisions based on skills, knowledge, and training (cognitive-based decisions). The fourth facet of intuitive decision-making utilizes values or ethics as guides. Lastly, the subconscious mental processing comes into play in executive decision-making. The main reason for managers’ using intuition is to make decisions fast and this is very important for the business organizations that function in more and more innovative and competitive environments.

    "explanation": "From a vacation with friends to your own career, from starting a small new business to managing a large corporation, you can hardly succeed without planning. For instance, one can hardly find a successful start-up business story without a business plan or any planning whatsoever. Even for funding a business for expansion or a start-up through seeking new investors and creditors, a business plan is a must. The main reason for this is that without planning there is no way one can figure out where a business is going.\n Thus, without planning, the remaining managerial functions of organizing, leading and controlling can hardly be done. Specifically, if we do not plan, then the other three functions will take more time and more mistakes will be generated along the way. For instance, the organizational goals set in planning, form the basis for standards against which managers can evaluate (control) the performance of the organization. This is why planning is often called the primary function of management."

Later, by the end of the first quarter, if 400 units of product X are sold, then the firm needs to increase production. However, if only 175 units are sold, then new plans must be devised to increase sales. No matter what has been done to increase the sales, if the sales continue to be lower than planned by the end of second and third quarters, then managers of this firm would start to think about revising the product or developing a new product.\n Therefore, with the help of this example, one can easily see how planning gives us a direction through setting of goals, helps us check and determine the level of goal achievement, and shows any need for modifying and changing the earlier plans or goals in order to become more effective."

    "explanation": "Internal Analysis<br/>Value chain analysis (VCA) is the process whereby a company determines the costs associated with organizational activities. The value chain analysis aims to identify where cost advantages or disadvantages exist anywhere along the value chain. The VCA process can enable a company to better identify its own strengths and weaknesses, especially as compared to a competitors’ value chain analyses and their own data examined over time. The initial step in implementing VCA is to divide a firm’s operations into specific activities or business processes. Then the analyst attempts to attach a cost to each discrete activity; the costs could be in terms of both time and money. Finally, the analyst converts the cost data into information by looking for competitive cost strengths and weaknesses that may yield competitive advantage or disadvantage. It is important to note that value chains differ vastly across industries and companies."

To take advantage of a star, the corporation must invest considerably in it. Question marks are SBUs that have a small share of a fast-growing market. If the corporation invests in these companies, they may finally become stars, but their relatively small share in the market makes investing in question marks more risky than investing in stars. Cash cows are SBUs which have a large share of a slow-growing market. SBUs in this situation are often highly profitable, therefore the name “cash cow.” Finally, dogs are SBUs which have a small share of a slow-growing market. As the name suggests, having a small share of a slow-growth market is often not profitable. Since dogs lose money, they should either be sold to other companies or closed down and liquidated for their resources."

    "explanation": "G<strong>lobal integrationlocal responsiveness framework</strong> indicates that cost pressure often require global integration and local responsiveness press companies to adapt locally. In both domestic and international competition, pressures for cost reductions are almost universal. What is unique in international competition is the pressure for local responsiveness, which is reflected in different consumer preferences and host country demands. Consumer preferences vary extremely around the world.\n A <strong>home replication strategy</strong> includes selling the same products in both domestic and foreign markets. It enables companies to leverage their home-based core competencies in foreign markets. A home replication strategy is either the first step companies take when beginning to conduct business abroad, or adopted by companies which own luxury brands.\n A l<strong>ocalization strategy</strong> requires maximizing local responsiveness hoping that local consumers will perceive the products as local ones. A localization strategy results from the combination of high pressure for local responsiveness and low pressure for cost reductions.\n A <strong>global-standardization strategy</strong> is composed of achieving significant economies of scale and low cost inputs by pursuing a global division of labor based on wherever best-of-class capabilities reside at the lowest cost. This strategy results from the combination of high pressure for cost reductions and low pressure for local responsiveness.\n A <strong>transnational strategy</strong> combines the benefits of a localization strategy (high local responsiveness) with those of a global-standardization strategy (lowest-cost position attainable). This strategy is generally used by companies that adopt an integration strategy at the business level by attempting to reconcile product differentiations at low cost. Moreover, global learning and diffusion of innovations (from home country to host countries and vice versa) are important elements of a transnational strategy."

A manager is responsible for all work in an area and can only complete the work by delegating part of the work to subordinates. This process continues down the chain of command. In general, the delegation process involves:\n ➢ Assign responsibility or the duty to perform certain tasks, \n ➢ Give authority to complete those tasks, and \n ➢ Create accountability for successful completion of the tasks. \n To be more effective at delegation, managers should keep in mind to select the right person for the job, to ensure that authority equals responsibility, to maintain feedback and to evaluate and to reward performance. In today’s dynamic business environment, managers may need to delegate more to lower level employees especially those who regularly face customers.

    "explanation": "Another issue in designing organization structure is the <strong>span of control </strong>or span of management which refers to the number of employees directly supervised by a manager. The question is the appropriate number of subordinates each manager can efficiently and effectively manage in the hierarchy. To use human resources effectively, managers should manage as many employees as they can. However, if they supervise too many subordinates then they may lose part of their effectiveness. Therefore, managers should limit the size in order to maintain closer control. There is no magic number of how many employees a manager should supervise. In today’s organizations, the span of control is believed to be determined by various contingency variables. In other words, organizations, employees and situations are different therefore require different spans of control for managers. \n In a mass production setting for example, workers perform similar tasks and those tasks are simple. In this case, a supervisor can manage larger numbers of workers. However, a CEO of a large firm probably cannot effectively manage many top executives all at once as their work is complex and interrelated. Therefore, in general, a manager’s ability to directly control subordinates is limited by the complexity of tasks and the interrelatedness of the subordinates’ tasks.1\n If the physical locations of subordinates are distant or if they need much coordination then the spans of control should be narrow. Also, when subordinates and/or supervisor are knowledgeable these factors would tend to widen the span of control. Managers can further implement some other forms of control within the company’s information systems used by employees in their jobs. This way, managers are able to widen the spans of control. For the same reason, the use of standard operating procedures would lead to a higher level of standardization of work activities and allow managers to supervise larger numbers of employees."

It shows a typical consulting firm structure where partners/managers can supervise relatively large numbers of associates, i.e. wider span of control. This is because in these types of firms, both partners and associates are knowledgeable about the topics in which they specialize.\n We can see that companies with tall structures tend to make decisions at a slower rate because the decisions need to pass through more layers of management in the hierarchy. <strong>Today’s business environment requires that organizations speed up their decision making and therefore have been flattening their structures.</strong> Also, businesses with fewer numbers of managers can reduce the human resources expenses. Larger spans of control and flattening of structures are consistent with managers’ efforts to speed up decision making, to increase flexibility and to reduce costs."

Thus, early leadership studies point out to traits and behaviors of leaders.\n <ul> <li>Traits Approach to Leadership</li> </ul> Early research on leader traits introduced characterisctics possessed by powerful leaders, which is called Great Man theory. Traits approach focused on identifying innate qualities and characteristics possessed by great social, political, and military leaders in history. The logic is to analyze what such leaders did to achieve highly challenging, at times impossible tasks. Atatürk, Lincoln, Napoleon, and Gandhi are examples of such traits.\n Leadership traits, as mentioned above, are sought for distingusihing leaders from non-leaders. However, as circumstances changed especially for business, leadership traits were developed and enhanced. It has been acknowledged that not one person can possess all positive traits. It has become more complicated to determine one set of traits for successfuly leading in all types of envrironments.\n <ul> <li>Behaviorial Approaches to Leadership</li> </ul> A focus solely on traits was not sufficient for separating leaders from others. Neither was it for analyzing the leadership process. This led to searching for the behavorial side of leadership characteristics\n <ul> <li>The Michigan studies: Based on interviews with managers and employees, this group of studies identified two basic forms of leadership behaviors: task/production oriented behaviors and people/ employee oriented behaviors. <ul> <li>Task-oriented behaviors indicate a focus on production and technical aspects of a job. Managers who were task-oriented were concerned about issues such as keeping low costs and scheduling meetings.</li> <li>People-oriented behaviors indicate a supportive approach to subordinates. Managers with this type of orientation dealt with high performance goals and human needs. Today, we must emphasize that the success and effectiveness of different behaviors depend on the necessity of the circumstances which is influenced by constant change.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The Ohio State studies: The results of this group of research were akin to Michigan studies. The researchers from Ohio State University introduced two basic leader behaviors or styles: initiating structure behavior and consideration behavior. <ul> <li>Initiating structure is parallel to the task oriented behavior and shows the emphasis on formal processes such as designing roles and responsibilities.</li> <li>Consideration behavior is a form of people orientation and indicates the extent of concern for the relationships with subordinates and their feelings.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The Managerial Grid: This model, which was renamed as the Leadership Grid, intersects two basic leadership behaviors, concern for people and concern for production. It also indicates the behavioral pattern of managers. The Managerial (Leadership) Grid is about the behaviorial dimension of leadership. The Managerial Grid consists of five managerial or leadership styles reflected in two dimensions which are concern for people and concern for production.</li> </ul> As also understood from the information given, the answer is C. “Task-oriented behaviors” and “People-oriented behaviors” were identified by The Michigan Studies."

    "explanation": "Fiedler’s Contingency Model: This model examines the match between the leadership style and the situation. The difference from the situational model is that Fiedler’s model adds organizational aspects to the situational variables. The focus of the Fiedler’s contingency model is to detect the leadership style and the situation correctly, so the most effective match can be decided. If this match is the right one then the group is most likely to be successful; if the match is not appropriate the group performance will be relatively low. Let’s examine how the leadership style and the situation is detected.\n Leadership styles in Fiedler’s contingency model are people (relationship) oriented and task oriented styles, similar to the situational model. What is different is that Fiedler suggests that leadership styles are pretty much fixed. Therefore, the leader matches her/his style with the situation that is most suitable for her/his effectiveness. Fiedler’s model includes the Least Prefered Co-Worker (LPC) scale for measuring leader styles. If a leader scores someone s/he least prefers high, it means that s/he is willing to develop good relationships and it is considered a relationship oriented style. If this score is low, it means the leader pays more attention on achieving the task and it is considered a task oriented style. According to Fiedler’s contingency model: leaders with high LPC are people oriented; leaders with low LPC are task oriented.\n As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

    "explanation": "After the leadership style is determined as whether people or task oriented, the stuation must be examined. By this token, the situational variables of Fiedler’s contingency model are: the quality of leader-member relations; the degree of task structure, and the position power.\n <ul> <li>Quality of leader-member relations involves factors such as the employees’ or group members’ trust and loyalty for the leader. This relationship can be either positive and good or negative and poor.</li> <li>Task structure is about to what extent the job requirements as well as the goals are clearly defined, formalized and standardized. Thus, a task structure can be a highly structured routine one or weakly structured which is out of routine. For example, the Mc Donalds franchising system works with highly standardized and clearly defined tasks of service, cooking, decorating, and cleaning of stores anywhere in the world.</li> <li>Position power is the amount of power that a leader has over her/his subordinates in terms of hiring, firing, promotion, and work orders. Thus, regarding these factors the power of a leader based on the position can be strong or weak.</li> </ul> The combination of the variables above shows the favorability of the leadership situation. A situation is considered highly favorable if: the leader-member relations are based on trust and respect; the task structure is highly structured; and the leader has strong power over her/his subordinates. On the other hand, a situation is mentioned as highly unfavorable if: the leadermember relations are poor; the task and roles are not clearly defined and standardized; and the leader has little authority for directing subordinates and issuing orders.\n As also undersood from the information given, the answer is C. “Quality of leader-member relations”, “Task structure” and “Position power” are the situational variables of Fiedler’s contingency model. “Inspirational motivation” and “Individualized consideration” are related to transformational leadership. Transformational leadership is explained in four I’s: charisma or idealized influence; inspirational motivation; intellectual stimulation; and individualized consideration."

Do you observe leaders, managers, or administrators being in close work relations with some but not as much with others, and even almost ignoring a number of people? Do you happen to be one of your manager’s favorite co-workers or have you ever or any of your peers felt left out?\n The answers to the questions above describes leader-member exchange theory (LMX). LMX suggests that leaders create in-groups and outgroups that they decide at the beginning of their relationship with their subordinates or followers. The leader then trusts the in-group members more than the others, consults and works closely with them, brings them to certain authority and responsibility positions, and also may reward them more in the form of their appraisals and promotions. In-groups can be formal or informal. In other words, they can take place in organizational charts or not. Business partners, top administration teams, heads of departments, board of directors, different committee members, or invisible in-group members are examples of LMX types of structures depending on the type and size of the enterprise, whether a business company or an informal social organization.

Transactional leaders also attach importance to issues such as communication, developing human resources, and motivation.

    "explanation": "The charm of the global competition cause businesses strive to go beyond their national borders and grow in international markets. Going international is a milestone for a business to get involved in cultures different from home. Culture encompasses values, beliefs, and norms that shape the way of living and thinking in a society. Culture strongly affects individuals and organizations within a society; thus we consider it the national culture of a country. The cultural conditioning process happens under the influence of values shaped by authority figures and environmental surroundings. The concept of multiculturalism emphasizes diversity in terms of cultural differences. Hence, <strong>multiculturalism</strong> refers to differences in values, beliefs, attittudes, customs, and norms that are held by people from different cultures.46 Note that, different regions or different communities in a country also may possess distinctive cultural characteristics as language, folklore, or traditions such as the Black Sea region in Turkey, the Quebecois region of Canada, or the aboriginal people of Australia.\n Considering the description of culture by Hofstede as “mental conditioning” for individuals such conditioning recurs in different settings throughout life: family culture; national culture; Professional culture; and organizational culture. <strong>Organizational culture</strong> is shared values that lead the way of operating towards the goal accomplishment. Organizations are sub-cultures of a national culture, embracing common values with national cultures.\n Managers in a multicultural work environment should possess a behavioral pattern such as ethnorelativism which is the opposite of ethnocentrism. <strong>Ethnorelativism</strong> is the approach that cultures are equal as well as being able to think from the perspectives of others. This type of thinking allows managers to create the best harmony utilizing the richness of the work force instead of unfairly judging others with different values. <strong>Ethnocentrism</strong> is the belief that one’s own culture is superior to others which creates barriers between members of a group or a work team.\n The fact that companies- namely international, multinational, or global- operating in foreign countries work with a diversified group of people, makes cultural encounters critical. Hence behaviors such as cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity then become bridging attitudes for employees of all levels from around the world towards unified goals.\n Managers in the global markets apply varying techniques and tools for successfully leading a diversified and multicultural workplace. On the other hand, factors such as technology, education, and industralization bring economies, cultures, and organizations closer. Cultural convergence is one of the results of such rapprochement. <strong>Cultural convergence</strong> is a process that eliminates the differences in values between nations, groups, or organizations.\n As also undertood from the information given, the answer is E. All of the definitions above related to leading across cultures in the options are correct."

The basic process for motivating employees starts with needs; continues with actions for the fulfilment of the needs; and results in satisfaction and rewards. The process starts with the needs that change by individuals and circumstances. Because all individuals have needs of this or that kind, motivation is a basic tool for all managers to create a happy and efficient work place. The motivation process continues with actions towards the fullfillment of the needs by the person, others, and most importantly by managers. The result of these actions are satisfactions and rewards either intrinsicly from within the person or extrinsicly from outside. Satisfaction as well as relief by completing a mission or innovating a product is an intrinsic reward. Satisfaction that is obtained from outside in the form of company shares, promotion, or being praised by the team leader is an extrinsic reward.

The information about the two factor theory and three-needs theory is as follows:\n The two-factor theory This perspective on motivation was introduced by Frederick Herzberg, also named as the motivationhygiene theory. Herzberg’s theory investigates employees’ relationship to the job. The theory content is based on interviews he conducted to find out when employees were satisfied and when dissatisfied, thus when they were motivated and unmotivated to work. The interview results proposed that the work factors which caused employees’ satisfaction were siginificantly different from the factors which caused dissatisfaction. The findings suggested that employees mentioned dissatisfaction based on extrinsic factors such as work conditions, supervision, interpersonal relations, security, and pay. On the other hand, work satisfaction is based on intrinsic factors such as achievement, responsibility, and success.\n Acquired needs perspective, also called three-needs theory and developed by David McClelland, proposes that certain needs acquired throughout one’s lifetime determine the motivation at work. The most common needs are: need for achievement(nAch); need for power (nPow); and need for affiliation (nAff)."
