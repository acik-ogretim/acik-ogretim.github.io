    "explanation": "Individuals’ health-related lifestyle choices-such as diet, exercise, smoking, or substance use-are shaped by several key factors. The passage emphasizes that these decisions often result from the interaction of personal preferences, social influences, psychological factors, and the perceived balance of benefits versus risks. For example, some people adopt veganism for health, ethical, or cultural reasons, while others continue behaviors like smoking or alcohol consumption due to social and psychological influences. Since “random chance” is not mentioned as a factor in the passage and does not logically explain such decisions, the correct answer is C) Random chance."

    "explanation": "The price elasticity can imply what happens to the total revenue of a healthcare firm (or total expenditure for consumers) when a price change occurs. “Total revenue” equals the quantity multiplied by the price. The relation between total revenue and elasticity can be summarized as follows: • if demand is elastic, one percentage rise in the price declines the quantity demanded by more than that, decreasing total revenue; • if demand is unit elastic, one percentage rise in the price declines the quantity demanded by one percentage, causing no change in total revenue; • if demand is inelastic, one percentage rise in the price declines the quantity demanded by less than that, increasing total revenue.

      "D": "The consumer has a long time to search for alternatives.",
      "E": "The consumer is highly loyal to a specific healthcare brand."
    },
    "explanation": "The factors affecting the price elasticity can be listed as follows (Guinness &amp; Wiseman, 2011: 59): • If closer substitutes exist, the price elasticity tends to be higher because individuals can simply switch among alternatives in case of a minor price change. • If a good takes a high portion of the income, the price elasticity tends to be higher. • Since individuals have more time to seek substitutes and alter their behavior, the price elasticity tends to be higher in the long run. • If the necessity of a good is higher for an individual, the price elasticity tends to be lower because an individual tries to buy whatever the price is. The price elasticity of insulin demand for diabetic patients can be given as an example. • If an individual is not required to directly pay for the good, the price elasticity tends to be more inelastic. The price elasticity in the case of employer-sponsored health insurance, can be given as an example. • The existence of brand loyalty can cause individuals to be unresponsive to changes in price, resulting in more inelastic demand. The correct answer is E."

      "A": "The percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a percentage change in price.",
      "B": "The responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in the availability of substitutes.",

      "E": "The relationship between total revenue and the price elasticity of demand."
    },
    "explanation": "“The income elasticity of demand” identifies the degree to which the demand changes for a change in income. Hence, the income elasticity is stated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income, or EY= %ΔQD/%ΔY. If EY takes positive values, the good is described as a normal good since an increase in income makes the quantity demanded rise. On the contrary, if EY takes negative values, the good is described as an inferior good since an increase in income makes the quantity demanded fall. Income elasticity tends to be positive for most types of healthcare services demand. The correct answer is C."
