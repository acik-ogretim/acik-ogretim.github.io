      "E": "nine"
    },
    "explanation": "Multi-track diplomacy claims that placing all aspects of unofficial diplomacy under track-two makes it difficult to seize whole scope and context of the field. For this reason, multi-track diplomacy offers a multilayer differentiation with nine tracks instead of two. It also foresees a cooperation with official diplomacy. Therefore, the first track in multitrack diplomacy is the government and its official representatives as the actors of traditional diplomacy. Track two would be the professional, experienced nonofficial attempts of conflict resolution through nongovernmental actors. Track three is defined as business and consequently is carried out by businessmen. This track is based on the assumptions that besides providing financial sources for conflict resolution and peace making efforts, these actors can also build mutual trust and friendship through economic and commercial channels. It is expected that economic ties and interests would forge the parties solve conflicts that could harm these ties and interests. Track four of multi-track diplomacy is carried out by private citizens. Often referred as citizen diplomacy, this track resembles the track-two diplomacy and makes it a sub-field of multi-track diplomacy. It brings together people from different sects of society, in workshops, exchange programs and joint projects in order to break prejudices and develop mutual understanding. Track five includes research, training, and education. Educational institutions from kindergarten to universities, research centres, tanks tanks can be actors of this diplomatic engagement. What is aimed with the mentioned activities is to get to the bottom of the conflict and formulate solutions through researches and study programs, train people who could carry out negotiation and mediation in resolving the conflict and raise awareness through educational institutions for a sustainable peace. Track six of multi-track diplomacy is activism and aims to raise awareness among the public and influence them though protests and gatherings about issues like peace, human rights, environment, social and economic justice. Track seven is religion and is based on directing the influence of religious beliefs, communities and institutions to conflict resolution by highlighting themes like shared values. Track eight is about the funding of all these multitrack diplomacy activities. The actors of this track, or the funders can be individuals, like philanthropists, or groups like communities, foundations and corporations. The last track, track nine is the communication and media. What is aimed with this track is to provide information that would influence the public opinion and bring people together despite the distances."

This assumption of diplomacy is closely related to Machiavelli’s conception of human nature which he defines as “For it can be said about men in general that they are ungrateful, fickle, dissembling, hypocritical, cowardly, and greedy.” Therefore the diplomat can use deceptions, tricks and schemes in order to maximise the state’s interest in its relations with other states.

    "explanation": "Hugo Grotius defines three methods to accommodate misunderstandings among states without a war. (Grotius, 1121-1127) The first of these methods is the conference method. The second method is arbitration between parties who do not belong to the same jurisdiction and have no common judge to appeal to, which he considers to be not only convenient but necessary that “Congresses of Christian states were held, where, by them who are no ways interested on one side or other, the differences of contending parties might be made up; and that some means were thought upon to oblige the parties at variance to accept of a peace upon fair and reasonable terms.” What Grotius has suggested is still an important method of conflict resolution in international relations and considered as one of the main functions of diplomacy. The third and the last method to prevent war according to Grotius is to cast lots. The correct answer is B."

    "explanation": "The first thing that has to be defined would be the scope of diplomacy since the other elements such as actors and tasks could only be determined according to how broad the scope is defined. When the term is taken in a narrow sense it usually describes political relations between states and includes the practices of the diplomats and ministries of foreign affairs. That is why history of international relations between states is defined as diplomatic history. Defining diplomacy as an instrument of foreign policy is not incorrect but is incomplete. In modern international relations it is no longer possible to define diplomacy only in terms of foreign policy or political relations between states that is carried out by statesmen and diplomats. The scope of diplomacy has expanded through the course of history. In several periods in history the scope of diplomacy has become a matter of discussion among the theoreticians and practitioners of diplomacy. Many have mentioned and accepted that there was old diplomacy and a new diplomacy. This points to the evolving character of diplomacy. Each era has a new diplomacy of its own. This is especially true for the twenty-first century. For this reason, it is necessary to adopt a broader approach. The correct answer is Choice C."

Satow owes his reputation in diplomatic theory to his book Guide to Diplomatic Practice, which was the first remarkable book in English language about the theory and practice of diplomacy when it was published in 1917. It is a comprehensive study which covers not only the roles and functioning of diplomatic institutions and actors but also gives a historical account of diplomacy.<br/>Hugo Grotius, who is one of the contributors of the diplomatic theory, a great opponent of war and deems it acceptable when it is just, and for this reason according to him diplomacy has a vital role. His work Three Books On the Law of War and Peace is the reflection of this approach. He defines three methods to accommodate misunderstandings among states without a war. (Grotius, 1121-1127) The first of these methods is the conference method. The second method is arbitration between parties who do not belong to the same jurisdiction and have no common judge to appeal to, which he considers to be not only convenient but necessary that “Congresses of Christian states were held, where, by them who are no ways interested on one side or other, the differences of contending parties might be made up; and that some means were thought upon to oblige the parties at variance to accept of a peace upon fair and reasonable terms.” What Grotius has suggested is still an important method of conflict resolution in international relations and considered as one of the main functions of diplomacy. The third and the last method to prevent war according to Grotius is to cast lots.<br/>Diplomacy, according to Machiavelli, must be permanent, in the sense that states should have diplomatic representatives, at least in those countries that they have high interests whether they are allies or enemies.

His theory of diplomacy can be derived from his Political Testament, in which he has penned political advice for Louis XIII. Having become the French prime minister in an age of continuous wars, Richelieu’s main concern was to establish peace and carry out peaceful relations with other states. For this reason he attributed great significance to diplomacy. The main theme of Richelieu’s theory is negotiations.<br/>The main theme in Guicciardini’s theory, which is generally outlined in his History of Italy, is the value of good ambassadors, which he sees as a source of prestige for the price. According to him a well-trained, qualified ambassador is a sign of value of the prince as well and should be rewarded.<br/>The correct answer is Choice D."

Another British diplomat who has contributed to diplomatic theory is Harold Nicolson. Like Satow he combined his experience with the history of diplomacy. In his book titled Diplomacy, which was published in 1939, a whole chapter is dedicated to the development of diplomatic theory. Another important writer who should be mentioned is Hans Morgenthau, who is considered the founder of international relations. Morgenthau’s theory, which he portrayed in his 1948 book Politics Among Nations, can also be read as a contribution to the theory of diplomacy although not dedicated to it. Morgenthau sees the quality of diplomacy as the most important of all the factors which make the power of a nation, since it is diplomacy that brings the different elements of national power to bear with maximum effect upon those points in the international situation which concern the national interest most directly. The last diplomatist/writer to be discussed in this chapter is Henry Kissinger. Kissinger’s famous work titled Diplomacy can actually be read as a history book and on many occasions he has been described as a historian. He does believe that international politics cannot be seized by only theoretical approach and for this reason the study of history is crucial. The correct answer is Choice D."

    },
    "explanation": "In very broad terms it is possible to separate diplomatic relations between states into two, depending on the number of actors, as bilateral diplomacy and multilateral diplomacy. Whereas bilateral diplomacy defines relations between two states multilateral diplomacy defines the relations between more than two such actors. As is defined in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the establishment of diplomatic relations between States, and of permanent diplomatic missions, takes place by mutual consent. (Article 2) Establishing diplomatic relations is only one of the facets of recognition for states. Likewise being accepted to an international organization is a sign of acceptance in a broader sense. Recognition by itself does not require the establishment of diplomatic relations but is a necessary prerequisite for establishing diplomatic relations. Similarly breaking of diplomatic relations does not mean the withdrawal of recognition. Breaking up of diplomatic relations is a unilateral act, realised by an announcement of any of the states, on the contrary to bilateral agreement of establishment. States establish mutual relations usually with an agreement that can be in the fashion of an announcement, a joint decision, exchange of notes or issuing of a communiqué and in some rare cases states just encounter without any kind of agreement but just the implication of having agreed to have relations.

What was novel about the League of Nations, especially in terms of diplomacy was that it served as permanent base for multilateral diplomacy which used be carried out through conferences that met for once and for some days only. Another phenomena that pushed the development of multilateral diplomacy was the significant increase in the number of states since 1945. Multilateral diplomacy has both strengths and weaknesses. On the weak side it may bring certain issues to a gridlock by any of the parties if a desired outcome is not reached. This may postpone or even sweep away the possibility of any solution. On the strong side it serves as a ground for cooperation. This cooperation can be directed to problem-solving as well as goal-setting in issues concerning the parties, which at times may include all states as in the case of League of Nations or United Nations.

    "explanation": "Crisis diplomacy defines the international efforts to manage and solve a crises. The need for crisis diplomacy has increased significantly since the world has become more interconnected and a crisis occurring in one region of the world becomes the concern of other states, on both regional and international level. It is to everyone’s knowledge that a major part of diplomacy is carried out in secrecy. Secret diplomacy refers to diplomatic engagements that take place without the knowledge of the public. However it does not mean that the diplomatic meetings that occur behind closed doors are secret diplomacy. If the term was defined in this way, almost all diplomatic intercourse would have to be defined as secret diplomacy. Neither does it mean confidentiality. What is meant by secret diplomacy is that the very existence of certain diplomatic meetings are kept secret from domestic and foreign publics.<br/>Coercive diplomacy defines the use of limited force or the threat of using force in diplomatic relations, with the aim of achieving desired ends. This makes coercive diplomacy a type of engagement that differs from the generally accepted conceptualisation that diplomacy involves peaceful means in interstate relations.<br/>Conference diplomacy refers to the multilateral diplomatic negotiations that take place in international conferences. But this does necessarily mean that all negotiations also occur with the participation of all actors. Bilateral or limited multilateral negotiations also take place among the participants of conference diplomacy.<br/>Summit diplomacy refers to the meetings of heads of states or governments.

Thus they prefer to establish alliances and coalitions with like-minded states, which would provide them a chance of leadership and influence. Middle powers perceive international institutions as the ideal framework for governing international affairs and strive to provide multilateral solutions to global problems and they also engage in multilateral activism to overcome a lack of bargaining power at the unilateral and bilateral level, and gain legality, legitimacy and moral authority for their assertive diplomatic initiatives.

The structure of the inter-state system caused another diplomatic formation as a means of foreign policy, forming alliances. In this line, considerable attention was given to the winning of allies and making of treaties during the 5th and especially 4th centuries. <strong>The duration of the alliances were mainly specified, particularly in the 5th century since alliances were founded on the basis of allying for war.</strong> In other words, city-states, aware of their weaknesses in face of each other, formed alliances in case of a threat of war. In the 4th century, alliance treaties began to be specified in duration as for ever, and the reason for this may be the new understanding of inter-state relations that alliances shall be based on peace rather than war (Mosley, 2001: 321-322)."

    "explanation": "Considering its longevity and organization, the Roman Empire contributed little to the development of diplomacy. This may be explained by their will to impose their policies on others instead of negotiating. As Nicolson mentioned <em>“…[Romans] they sought to impose their will, rather than to negotiate on a basis of reciprocity” </em>(Nicolson, 2001:14). This, of course, does not mean that diplomacy was unimportant for the Romans. Rather, it had an important place in governing their relations with rival states in Italy and in managing their relations with foreign peoples after establishing their empire. However, as it is widely accepted that the contribution of Romans to diplomacy is much more related to the international law and is represented in the theory, not the practice, of diplomacy."

    },
    "explanation": "Although Greece is accepted as the birthplace of Western civilization, diplomacy was not born in Greece in contrast to what is widely thought. Diplomacy was born thousands of years before ancient Greece committed to diplomacy as a civilization. Nevertheless, the word “diplomacy” is itself borrowed from ancient Greek. It is derived from the word “diploma” meaning two fold. In the Roman Empire, the word was used to describe the passes, comparable to the modern day passport, which were stamped on metal plates. This word was later extended to cover other metallic documents, especially those embodying arrangements with foreign communities<br/>The first system of city-states occurred in Mesopotamia between the 4th and the first millennium. The system was mainly based on that of the Sumerians in the south, Babylonian and Akadian in the center and Assyrians in the north.<br/>Sumerians were the earliest practitioners of diplomacy (3000-2370 BCE). The diplomatic tradition emerged from this site mainly because the Sumerians were the civilization which invented writing sometime in the 4th millennium BCE. In the meantime, Sumeria was the site of the first urban communities consisted of complex social, economic and political structures each of which was ruled by an independent King.<br/>The features of the first exchange systems of organized polities resemble in many ways the diplomacy as we now understand. They were conducted by envoys in a formal framework of law; and they were based upon the principles of reciprocity. With the emergence of the state system, the methods of diplomacy were transformed from primitive courses into trade agreements, dynastic marriages, and military alliances.<br/>Diplomacy was used by Sumerians with a motivation to end conflicts through the conventional method of sending messengers with the messages written on clay tablets in cuneiform. Sumerian was used as the <em>lingua franca </em>of diplomacy until the Akhadian hegemony was established in the region.<br/>The correct answer is Choice E."

This letter provides a clear evidence of the existence of a well performing mechanism, in which both sides knew the rules. The letter was not written by the king himself, but through the voice of an official, and was not directed to the Hamazi King but to his envoy (Podany, 2010: 27). Since the Ebla region had priority in trade, diplomacy was mainly a part of their trade relations, the reflection of which could also be seen in the Ebla letter. The correct answer is Choice A."

Their primary function involved coordinating diplomatic efforts. Some of them were regarded explicitly as the king’s personal representatives. Diplomatic envoys were protected by their diplomatic status and they were free to journey across boundaries even in times of crisis. In other words, they had a kind of “diplomatic immunity” which was evident in many documents that found in Mari and later in other archives. Even to attest their status, diplomats seemed to have a kind of “diplomatic passport”, on which the name of the holder, the description of his delegation and his destination were written.

    "explanation": "Ancient China can be categorized under two different periods regarding the political structure of the time. The first is the Warring States Era between 656-221 BCE, characterized by the emergence of sovereign states. It was a period of a balance of a power system, so international relations was based on great power rivalry and ephemeral alliances. The Great Powers had leagues, missions and an organized system of correspondence between their many warring states. Diplomacy was based on bilateral relations and missions related to fleeting alliances including maneuvers, secrecy and bribery Chinese states had no permanent friends and enemies; therefore, their strategies were ruthless but still in an equilibrium. It is not surprising that Sun-Tzu, one of the best known military strategists, and his thoughts were influential at this period. Early records indicate that Sun-Tzu lived in the Warring state era and his very famous work <em>The Art of War </em>was influenced by the increasing violence of this era. In contrast to its name, the book does not really focus on war time strategies, but on strategies that would prevent the outbreak of war. The core of the strategy for Sun Tzu is not to defeat the enemy in battle, but to repress him without fighting. Sun Tzu therefore focuses on the pre-war period as the realm for strategy and hence pays particular attention to diplomacy at this stage. The correct answer is Choice A."

India at this period was mostly composed of a number of small independent states, being in a rivalry with each other with the exception of the Magadha kingdom. Kautilya played an important role in the fall of the Magadha kingdom and the rise to power of the Mauryan dynasty. In fact, Kautiya was a political realist; and the key theme of his theory represented in his book was war. According to Kautilya, war is what defines inter-state relations. Kautilya defined six forms of foreign policy.<br/><ul> <li>Peace: entering into a treaty; when the state is weaker than the enemy, it should make peace.</li> <li>War: attacking and doing injury; when the state is stronger than the enemy, it should make war.</li> <li>Non alignment: staying quiet; when the state is equal with the enemy and neither is capable of harming the other, the state should stay quiet.</li> <li>Seeking shelter: When threatened by a stronger enemy the state should seek protection from another stronger state, somewhat forming an alliance.</li> <li>Shows of force: When the state is increasing in capabilities, it should augment and mobilize resources to prepare for war.</li> <li>Double-dealing: When a state seeks help for attacking another state, it resorts to peace and war at the same time with different states.

    "explanation": "Diplomacy was a necessity for the Byzantine Empire because it had enemies on all of its borders and there was always a threat of invasion while for a certain time it had limited military power. The military force of the Byzantine Empire never exceeded the number of 140.000. While the threat of invasion came from all quarters, e.g., from Nomadic people to Germanic people, from Slavs to Hungarians and Russians, its internal resources were not enough to keep a military permanently in order to give a military response to these threats. Since the rulers of the empire were aware of their military weakness, they first adapted the practices of former civilizations and developed their own way of diplomacy with their political and cultural contributions. For example, they adapted the practices of protocol and dynastic marriages from the Near Eastern civilization, oration as a tool for public speaking from Greece, and the divide and rule tactics from the Roman Empire. In this manner the diplomatic methods they exercised were ranging from the, formation of alliances to dynastic marriages, from exploiting the enemy’s weaknesses, to deception and the use of religion. for a certain time it had limited military power.

In fact, the main motive in the use of diplomacy for the Byzantine Empire was to avoid war, and all diplomatic practice was devoted to this aim. Therefore, the empire used diplomacy as a means of foreign policy continuously, employing more emphasis on it than military means. The Byzantines employed a number of tactics, both overt and covert to achieve their aims through diplomacy rather than military force. It is therefore common to label Byzantine diplomacy as “<em>war by other means</em>” (Antonucci, 1993: 11). They were unique in their method of involvement in internal affairs of other countries. For this aim, the empire initiated a new institution for diplomatic practice, the Bureau of Barbarians. The Bureau of Barbarians as a department of government was responsible for foreign relations, primarily with the barbarians living on the Balkan Peninsula. The correct answer is Choice B."

    "explanation": "Diplomacy in the Islamic world began with the establishment of the first Islamic state in 622; and it was not founded through military means but by a social contract, the Medina Charter. The function of diplomats was to communicate with other states, to conclude an agreement or alliance which was decided previously, to arrange the exchange of prisoners and the truce, and to announce war. Most certainly, another function of envoys was to gather information about the weaknesses and/or strengths of the host country. The function of diplomacy in these early years was at the most basic level since the strength of the state in the absence of at least an equal power did not raise the need to a more complex function for diplomacy. Diplomatic contact between Islamic or Arab, Byzantine and also Latin rulers were frequent in the Middle Ages. The motives for diplomatic practice were similar to other ages and civilizations: political concern regarding peace and war, economic or commercial motives and definitely information gathering. Emissaries played the most important role in this vein; and it can be said that diplomatic envoys were great travelers in the Middle Ages. As Drocourt stated, they usually spent more time travelling than negotiating because of the distance between the Arab region and Constantinople or the whole Western part of Christendom.

In fact, religious affairs were the dominant theme in the agenda of this department, as it was in contact mainly with the authorities in Vatican. In fact, almost all of the personnel working in this department were coming from a clergy background.

However, the emergence of a ministry as a modern department of foreign affairs had to wait until the overthrow of the Ancien Régime. Still, France was earlier than other European states to initiate a ministry whose sole responsibility was to conduct foreign policy."

    "explanation": "The political authorities of the “Old World” were far from being as organized as modern state structures. The main difference between ancient states and modern state structures was lying in the capacity of centralization. The ancient states in the “Old World” were mainly constituted of some local authorities which control a piece of land militarily and economically. These local authorities were brought together under more general state structures borders of which reach out broader territories. Although they resemble medieval empires in terms of their organization, these states lacked the permanent institutions, mainly built upon decentralized structures, and their borders were not very well-defined. What we call “ancient diplomacy” today took place both within and among these states of the “Old World”. <strong>The diplomatic practices</strong> within an ancient state took place among the local authorities such as feudal lords, chieftains and tribal leaders. These practices vary from mutual visits to trade and security related agreements between them. Although we consider these practices as the forerunners of diplomacy in the ancient world, it should be noted that they <strong>were not operated through institutionalized structures</strong>."

In other words, regardless of their size, power and location, Italian city states came to a consensus in which they are all treated and assumed equivalent to each other. At this point, it should be noted that the principle of functional equality can be considered as the main constituting element of modern diplomacy. In fact, diplomatic interaction between two political entities only started after the mutual acceptance of equivalency by both parties in the medieval and Renaissance Europe.

      "E": "Resident ambassadors in European countries became a British diplomatic custom mainly before 1648"
    },
    "explanation": "options A,B, and D are related with France.<br/>With the Peace of Westphalia, German principalities institutionalized the notion of resident ambassador just like Italian city states did in the 16th century. In the beginning, most of the principals sent their envoys to Brandenburg-Prussia and other great powers in the German world. In the longer run, keeping a permanent diplomatic mission in other countries spread all over German principalities. Principals preferred to have resident diplomatic missions mostly in farer principalities, as closer or neighboring principalities were accessible through short trips.<br/>The British also copied and internalized these diplomatic customs. British envoys were sent to the states of the continental Europe mainly after the Peace of Westphalia. Britain, being one of the actors in the peace talks, did not withdraw its committee from Münster and Osnabrück, two German-speaking cities where peace talks took place, and distributed this team later to Sweden, France, Brandenburg-Prussia and Denmark. Although several British diplomatic missions were sent to other countries earlier, resident ambassadors in European countries became a British diplomatic custom mainly after 1648.<br/>France can be noted as one exception to this. Although France did have envoys and resident diplomatic missions in several countries as early as the beginnings of 16th century, it did not follow the general European fashion to build resident and constant diplomatic missions in European capitals. Yet, France has come forward as the country which kept most active contact with the Muslim world. French envoys were sent to Ottoman Empire in 1535 and Safavid Empire (present day Iran) in 1600s (Black, 2010: 54). Still, France was late to institutionalize the resident ambassadors compared to other primary European powers. Yet, it is also worthy to note that once the French developed their own diplomatic system, it was admired by other European states as it was first fully-developed system of diplomacy (Berridge, 2010: 103)."

It could be seen ironic that Napoleon himself abolished the Republic and turned himself into a monarch, yet he imposed nationalist republics in the states that he controlled through Napoleonic Wars. In other words, Napoleon appeared as the distributer of two very dangerous ideologies throughout the Europe: republicanism and nationalism."

As diplomacy was professionalized and acknowledged as a field which requires special expertise and training, the states of Europe also recognized the need for a specific ministry under the government which is solely responsible from the conduct of foreign policy.<strong> France was again the first country which initiated a specific department responsible from the foreign policy</strong>. In <strong><em>Ancien Régime, </em></strong>Henry III initiated a department and gave the sole responsibility in foreign policy to a specific department under the government as early as 1589 (Berridge, 2010: 6)."

Firstly, the political equation among small Italian city states facilitated the consolidation of diplomacy as a preferred tool for solution of the problems in the Peninsula. Italian city states were in fact feudal units controlled by certain dynasties. ...In other words, regardless of their size, power and location, Italian city states came to a consensus in which they are all treated and assumed equivalent to each other. At this point, it should be noted that the principle of functional equality can be considered as the main constituting element of modern diplomacy. Secondly, the common language that is shared by all these small city states served as another facilitator for diplomatic progress in the region. Despite the lack of a political unity among the city states, there was a linguistic unity among them. Italian, being the lingua franca in the Peninsula, was accepted as the common language for any form of correspondence among the city states. Thirdly, the small scale political organization due to over-fragmented political structure in the Peninsula rendered some other coercive political tools such as war much more costly and ineffective. Italian city states were quite small in terms of their size and capacities. The correct answer is E."

Diplomatic interactions of the ancient world were built upon quite an intermittent structure and shaped in an issue-specific manner. They did play a role in the formation of customs in the field of trade and crystallization of the borders. Yet, the modern diplomacy, which required continuity and constant contact, emerged in the Renaissance Italy.

After the formation of modern diplomacy, states began to adapt professional and permanent institutions and instruments.

However, as opposed to the general view that the Ottomans did not take part in diplomatic relations due to the sense of superiority up until the 18th century, they attached great importance to their diplomatic relations from the beginning. The basic tools of Ottoman diplomacy were <em>Âmans </em>(mercies) and capitulations which reflected the unilateral nature of Ottoman diplomacy and started to be granted to Venetians as early as the reign of Mehmed II (<em>Fatih</em>) in the 15th century. In the heydays of the Ottoman rule, Suleyman I (<em>Kanuni</em>) granted capitulations to France. Initially, capitulations were economic, political and legal privileges granted to foreign states and subjects. However, as time passed and the empire began to decline, they turned into burdens on the Ottoman Empire hard to carry."

From the beginning, they established close relations not only with <em>Beyliks </em>(tribes) in Anatolia, but also with the Byzantine Empire. Through inter-tribal or inter-state marriages, they consolidated their power and expanded their territories. Therefore, the Ottoman Empire cannot be regarded as an entity solely ruled by strict Islamic laws, rather it was also influenced by customary laws and local customs. Ottoman Sultans like Mehmed II issued <em>qanunnames </em>(books of law) in accordance with the Turkish state tradition empowered rulers to make laws, so the Ottoman system was not only ruled by religious laws, but also by customary laws. Such a legal system provided flexibility and pragmatism to the policies of the empire. (Yurdusev, 14-15)"

They carried out their diplomatic relations on the basis of unilateralism and there was no room in the Ottoman diplomacy for relations on the basis of equality and mutuality. Therefore, they did not adapt the rules of modern diplomacy until early 1790s because they did not want to make concessions to “inferior” states. However, as opposed to the general view that the Ottomans did not take part in diplomatic relations due to the sense of superiority up until the 18th century, they attached great importance to their diplomatic relations from the beginning."

      "E": "Ottoman diplomacy was heavily influenced by the strict laws of Islam"
    },
    "explanation": "Despite their unilateral nature, the Ottoman rulers made long-lasting agreements with non- Muslims. These treaties were renewed regularly so there was an intention to establish state of peace except several wars in the Ottoman foreign policy. For example, Bayezid II signed an agreement with Pope Innocent VIII. In this treaty, the Sultan and the Pope agreed on the capturing of his brother Cem in France rather than sending him to the foes of the Ottomans in return for the control of Jerusalem by the French King after it had been taken by the Ottoman Empire from Mamluks. (Yurdusev, 16) The deal between the Sultan and the Pope shows the pragmatism of Ottomans in their diplomatic relations.<br/>The main objective of the Ottoman rulers through conducting these pragmatic relations with foreign states was to be an influential actor in the European system. The Sultans carried out cautious diplomatic relations with the European states with considering balance of power in the European states system. Thus, Yurdusev argued that this diplomatic pragmatism triggered, to some extent, the formation of nation states in Europe. On the other hand, as the Ottomans became a powerful empire and a part of this power game, the European states had to take the Ottomans into consideration while making their decisions and implementing their policies, so from time to time they allied with the Ottoman sultan against each other. Therefore, the role of the Ottoman Empire in the European states system facilitated the preservation of <em>status quo</em>. (Yurdusev, 22) Especially in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Ottoman rulers supported the English and Dutch against the Habsburgs, the main enemy of the Ottomans at that time, because these states were the forerunners of European resistance against Habsburgs’ dominance in the continent. On the other hand, the Ottoman rulers benefitted from the religious rivalry in Europe and they supported Protestants and Calvinists against the Catholics because this religious split in the continent was an important tool in the war against Habsburgs. The Ottoman pressure on the Habsburgs triggered the spread of Protestantism in Europe. (Yurdusev, 23)"

      "D": "It was not used as a leverage to expand its territories and reach its objectives",
      "E": "They were temporary agreements"
    },
    "explanation": "Since the establishment of the Ottoman Empire, diplomacy was a significant tool for inter-tribal and inter-state relations. As a part of diplomatic strategy, Ottoman sultans married daughters of chiefs of other tribes or monarchs of the Byzantine Empire. Main objectives of this strategy were developing friendly relations with other states and expanding territories through obtaining new lands as dowry. On the other hand, in the heydays of the Ottoman Empire, its relations with foreign states were not based on mutuality, but on unilaterality. This system was known as the <em>Âman </em>(Mercy) System. <em>Âman </em>was the privilege or immunity granted by the sultan to foreigners or non-Muslims. This system which protected the rights of non-Muslims within the boundaries of the empire was unilaterally granted by the Ottomans. (Turan, 26)<br/>In addition, <em>Âman </em>system constituted the basis of treaties and agreements signed between the Ottomans and foreign states. In accordance with the principles of this system, Ottomans signed treaties and armistice with foreign states for no more than ten years, so they were temporary agreements rather than permanent ones due to the <em>ghaza </em>policy derived from the Islamic dogma. However, this does not mean that the empire was in a permanent war with foreigners or non-Muslims, but it was used as a leverage to expand its territories and reach its objectives. On the other hand, these <em>Âmans </em>and treaties with foreign states were controlled and approved by Sheikh-ul Islam (the head of religious affairs). When the Ottoman Empire was powerful, the basic criteria for these <em>Âmans </em>and treaties was the interests of the state and its subjects. <em>Âmans </em>and treaties against the interests of the state were ruled out by the Sheikh-ul Islam. For example, despite an agreement between the Ottoman Empire and Venice on the basis of <em>Âmans</em>, with the fatwa of Sheikh-ul Islam Ebussuud Efendi, the empire launched an attack to Cyprus in 1570. This shows the pragmatism of Ottoman rulers which affected their foreign relations and diplomacy. (İskit, 147)"

    "explanation": "Therefore, the first Ottoman Embassy was established in London in 1793 and this was a turning point in Ottoman diplomacy. Being aware of the loss of dominance and superiority over the European powers, which had become more powerful starting with colonization and continued with the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution, Ottoman rulers used all instruments and institutions of diplomacy. The Industrial Revolution also played a serious role in the erosion of Ottoman power. With the accumulation of capital and boom in economic production, Western states hegemonized the international relations. On the contrary, the Ottoman Empire could not keep up pace with these developments and began to collapse due to the lack of initiative to adapt new rules and developments in technology, science, military and economy."

      "E": "They have attached great importance to the solution of problems through diplomacy"
    },
    "explanation": "However, with regard to foreign policy and diplomacy, there are certain commonalities between the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic.<br/>First of all, the Turkish Republic was established on the same geography despite shrinkage of Ottoman territories after the 18th century. The Straits and geographical location, as a bridge between Europe and Asia, of the Turkish Republic can be considered as important elements of its foreign policy. On the one hand, these elements enable Turkey, as a medium-sized power as opposed to the Ottoman Empire claiming global superiority, to carry out negotiations in order to maximize its interests to the extent possible, but, on the other hand, as a state encircled by regions like the Balkans and the Middle East full of problems forces it to conduct a cautious foreign policy and diplomacy.<br/>Secondly, the mindset of the Republican rulers and diplomats have been shaped by the Ottoman balance of power strategy especially after the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Both its founders Atatürk and İnönü and their successors tried hard to increase the number of friends and decrease the number of enemies. Especially during WWII and the Cold War, Turkey tried to establish alliances with Western powers like the Great Britain and France against German and Italian revisionism and expansionism during WWII and the United States against the Soviet claims and threat during the Cold War. The global conjuncture and Turkey’s own interests like protection of territorial integrity and sovereignty, economic development and military modernization necessitated to do so. This also shows the Western-oriented foreign policy and diplomacy since the beginning of modernization and Westernization efforts in the Ottoman Empire by Selim III.<br/>Thirdly, rulers of the Turkish Republic similar to the Ottoman sultans and the statesmen especially during the decline and collapse periods have refrained from wars and they have attached great importance to the solution of problems through diplomacy. In this vein, Turkey became a member of League of Nations (LoN) in 1932 upon its invitation and joined the United Nations (UN) after WWII and NATO in 1952. Protection of regional and global <em>status quo </em>as well as Turkey’s sovereignty and territorial integrity have been the priorities of Turkish statesmen. In addition, when Turkish foreign policy in the Republican era is considered, the dominance of leaders in the formulation of foreign policy can be clearly seen. Starting from Atatürk, dominant figures like İsmet İnönü, Adnan Menderes, Süleyman Demirel, Bülent Ecevit, Turgut Özal and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan have become influential figures in Turkish foreign policy."

For some scholars, it derived from the perception of Islam as a universal religion and the Ottomans’ duty of safeguarding and expanding the rule of Islam. However, it can be argued that the basic motive of Ottoman sultans was to expand their imperial power rather than solely expanding territories under the flag of Islam. Therefore, the Ottoman rulers did not try to establish bilateral diplomatic relations and missions in foreign countries until the 18th century due to their imperial claims and the sense of superiority rather than religious biases which impeded their mutual relations on the basis of equality which is an important principle of modern diplomacy."

However, the decadence of the Ottoman power cannot be explained only by external factors. In other words, after the 16th century, the empire was not ruled by strong and competent rulers as Mehmed II, Selim I and Suleyman I. The administrative system and the palace were full of problems. In addition, especially after mid-1600s, the Ottoman economy started to weaken with the end of territorial expansions, discovery of new routes and defeats in wars with stronger European states as a result of the formation of modern states and armies. Lastly, but more importantly, the Ottoman military system which was the major source of Ottoman power began to decline after the 16th century. Janissaries as the crux of the Ottoman military power lost their discipline and prestige as well as their adaptation to modern war techniques and tactics."

Starting from the Balkans, all minorities in the Ottoman Empire came up with the demands for independence or at least equality among communities. Ottoman millet (community) system prevented them from being treated as equals. In this process, Ottoman subjects in the Balkans, started with Serbs in 1804 and Greeks in 1821, revolted against the Ottoman Empire. In order to save the empire from disintegrating and prevent foreign countries, like Russia claiming protectorate over the Slavs in the Balkans, from intervening in domestic policies, the Ottoman rulers had to take some serious measures. In 1839 Tanzimat Edict and in 1856 Islahat (Reform) Edict were declared to grant some rights and privileges to the foreign subjects of the Empire"

      "E": "states not joining multilateral conferences don’t lose the right to have a say"
    },
    "explanation": "Multilateral diplomacy is literally defined as diplomatic relations between more than two states. It is also known as “conference diplomacy” or “parliamentary diplomacy” because multilateral diplomatic relations are mainly conducted through conferences and face-to-face interaction between leaders or missions of states. Its origins go back to Vienna Congress convened in 1815 after Napoleonic Wars when European powers came up with the idea of balance of power strategy which sustained peace in Europe until WWI. Multilateral diplomacy became popular in the 20th century because problems between states turned into global problems such as peace and security, environment, health, migration, etc. and international actors understood that such problems had to be negotiated and solved through multilateral diplomacy. The rise of democracy and its ideals after WWII resulted in the democratization of diplomacy and diplomatic practices. More importantly, the accountability of states to their domestic public opinion as well as world public opinion necessitated the establishment of the instruments and institutions of multilateral diplomacy. As a result, multilateral conferences or organizations aim to provide the support of all parties in the solution of global problems which require support and initiative of all sides. There are many advantages of multilateral conferences like focusing on specific issues and motivating the parties to find a solution or reach an agreement in a limited period of time. As a result of collaboration among participants, it develops closer relations between states. Finding a solution or reaching an agreement is beneficial for all parties because it increases their prestige and popularity. Due to the limited period of time, multilateral conferences force parties to focus on specific issues and come up with solutions. (İskit, 307-308) On the other hand, multilateral conferences are used by powerful states to make their propaganda as dominant states in the international arena as well as drawing the attention of all states to global problems such as environmental and economic issues. Joining such conferences and organizations increase the prestige of participants. On the contrary, states not joining these multilateral entities may lose their prestige and the right to have a say in ultimate decisions."

      "D": "Recognition is a part of “mutual consent",
      "E": "Recognition and diplomacy always go hand-in-hand"
    },
    "explanation": "Bilateral diplomacy is conducted between two states, but, initially, these two states have to recognize each other to establish diplomatic missions and carry out diplomatic practice. Recognition means the acceptance of the existence of a state as an independent and sovereign entity in the international arena. Recognition consists two rights of a state: domestically it has to enjoy full sovereignty over its territories, internationally it has to be independent from any other state. Moreover, membership to the 0 (UN) is another criterion for recognition. UN membership is an indicator of global recognition and today almost all states with full sovereignty and independence are members of UN. On the other hand, according to the second article of the Vienna Convention, which was accepted in 1961 and determines the rules, instruments and institutions of diplomacy, diplomatic relations between states have to be based on “mutual consent.” Recognition is a part of “mutual consent”, but recognition and diplomacy do not always go hand-in-hand. More clearly, states may recognize each other, but not carry out diplomatic relations."

      "D": "It develops closer relations between states",
      "E": "It is used by powerful states to make their propaganda"
    },
    "explanation": "There are many advantages of multilateral conferences like focusing on specific issues and motivating the parties to find a solution or reach an agreement in a limited period of time. As a result of collaboration among participants, it develops closer relations between states. Finding a solution or reaching an agreement is beneficial for all parties because it increases their prestige and popularity. Due to the limited period of time, multilateral conferences force parties to focus on specific issues and come up with solutions. (İskit, 307-308) On the other hand, multilateral conferences are used by powerful states to make their propaganda as dominant states in the international arena as well as drawing the attention of all states to global problems such as environmental and economic issues. Joining such conferences and organizations increase the prestige of participants. On the contrary, states not joining these multilateral entities may lose their prestige and the right to have a say in ultimate decisions. Non-participating states may suffer from the decisions made against them in these conferences. Therefore, all the states having an interest in such meetings push hard for participation. Furthermore, multilateral diplomacy provides a medium for the development of bilateral relations because through bilateral meetings or social events during multilateral conferences such as NATO and EU meetings, heads or missions of states may develop their contacts and relations. Lastly, multilateral conferences may ensure compliance with agreements or decisions made by the states better than bilateral ones due to the pressure of other states and world public opinion."

Frequently organized and long meetings enable the participants to reach some conclusions and solve problems. Moreover, due to the length of such meetings, there is room for re-negotiation unless parties don’t reach a conclusion in the first trial. In time, as these summits are regularly convened, their principles are specified and their efficiency increases. More importantly, regular meetings allow leaders to prepare before sessions and learn details of issues discussed in these meetings as well as characteristics and tendencies of their counterparts. Summits are effective tools to conclude negotiations discussed in international forums successfully. In order to reach conclusions satisfactory for both sides, leaders push hard for succeed in these summits, so the “diplomatic momentum” between two summits continues. Regular meetings of European Union (EU) leaders are important examples of these meetings."

Camp David meetings in 1978 led by Jimmy Carter to discuss peace settlement between Egypt and Israel with the participation of Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin can be regarded as an example of <em>ad hoc </em>summit. After twelve days of negotiations, both sides agreed on signing a peace agreement. Main objective of an ad hoc summit is to create a symbolic milestone for solution of a specific problem between states. Another example of <em>ad hoc </em>summits is funeral ceremonies of leaders.

    "explanation": "Lastly, high-level meetings can be defined as meetings of leaders within the context of their official visits. Especially, newly elected leaders visit foreign countries and meet their counterparts. Such visits provide information about policies and characteristics and opinions of their counterparts. In addition, leaders aim at developing friendly relations and economic relations with the host country. To sum up, like bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, summit diplomacy is an important instrument of modern diplomacy. However, it needs to be underlined that these instruments are not mutually-exclusive. In other words, summit diplomacy can be used as a part of bilateral or multilateral diplomacy. Like bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, summit diplomacy has some advantages and disadvantages. The efficiency of these diplomatic instruments depend on the power and capabilities of states as well as the institutions using these instruments. Diplomatic missions, ministries of foreign affairs and non-state actors such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and multi-national companies (MNCs) are basic institutions of modern diplomacy."

However, due to its internal problems like strategies and policies of its main actors towards the losers of WWI, it became futile less than two decades. With its inability to prevent Italian invasion of Abyssinia, Japanese invasion of Manchuria and Nazi invasion of Austria and Czechoslovakia, the prestige of the institution dramatically decreased and these developments resulted in the eruption of WWII."

With the defeat of Napoleon in Russia and Great Britain, European states decided to establish such a system in order to prevent the birth and rule of Napoleon-like figures and states. Concert of Europe system worked until the First World War (WWI) despite some regional conflicts and wars. However, with the polarization in the early 1900s, this system was replaced by alliances and divisions that paved the way for WWI."

As Turkey’s contribution to Europe’s security within NATO has gradually become less-emphasized, absent the common Soviet threat, the quality of Turkey’s relations with European states has become very much a function of Turkey’s EU membership process. In an environment in which the number of people who argued that NATO would remain either ‘out of area’ or ‘out of business’ increased and Turkey’s security began to be increasingly affected by the developments taking place in non-European geographies, it has become more difficult to build Turkey’s foreign and security policies primarily on the Western axis, of which NATO has been the most important component."

State is the main actor that provides security; state elites define which issues should be considered as security issues; security interests are defined in reference to the survival and well-being of the state. For a long time, the prevailing understanding was that issues of diplomacy, foreign policy and national security were so much existential and vital that they should not be left to the discretion of the politicians who only think how they can win upcoming elections and remain in power. State elites would, on the other hand, put national interests at the center of their behaviors and approach vitally important issues from the perspective of state."

Open discussion of such issues before the public is generally seen as risky. Diplomatic issues require expertise. For a long time, only the state elites nested in bureaucracy were assumed to have possessed this expertise. The participation of civil society and non-state actors in the formulation of Turkey’s foreign policy interests has been quite limited compared to liberal democratic countries in the West. Diplomacy has always been the privilege of state elites in Turkey. It is during the process of Europeanization and democratization that civil society has finally begun to acquire an important role in Turkish diplomacy. It is now the case that both elected politicians are more knowledgeable than before about foreign policy and diplomatic issues and think tanks have mushroomed as institutional platforms offering expert-help to decision makers."

It is now the case that both elected politicians are more knowledgeable than before about foreign policy and diplomatic issues and think tanks have mushroomed as institutional platforms offering expert-help to decision makers. Turkish rulers have also inherited an imperial mentality from the Ottoman era in that Turkey has long been seen as the continuation of the Empire. The imperial mentality also manifests itself in the way how Turkish rulers interact with their counterparts in other countries. Turkish rulers tend to speak with foreigners as if today’s Turkey is the Ottoman Empire of the sixteenth century. Longing for respect, equality and status very much shapes Turkey’s relations with much powerful countries. Imperial mentality also suggests that Turkey holds itself responsible for the well-being of people living in the post-Ottoman geography. The practice of defining Turkey as a responsible diplomatic actor that should contribute to the solution of regional and global humanitarian, developmental and security problems has strengthened during the reign of Justice and Development Party governments since 2002. The imperial mentality seems to have made itself appear in the foreign policy discourse of the AKP era politicians. For example, former Prime Minster Ahmet Davutoglu quite often said that the scope of Turkish diplomacy is global and Turkey should act as an order-creator country in its environment. The circles that see Turkey through imperial eyes find it difficult to understand that the Republic of Turkey constitutes a break with the Ottoman past."

      "D": "Europeans seem enthusiastic to admit Turkey to EU",
      "E": "Turks love and hate Westerners simultaneously"
    },
    "explanation": "Westernization is also thought of a security strategy in that Turkey would feel itself safe and secure if it came closer to the West/Europe and its Western/European identity were recognized as such by Westerners/Europeans (Oğuzlu, 2003, 285- 299). Given that the Ottoman Empire came to an end at the hands of the Western European nations, the founding fathers of the Republic assumed that Turkey’s security would improve, if Europeans saw Turkey as a member of the Western/European family of nations.<br/>This process has both negative and positive connotations in the context of Turkish diplomatic history. Turks love and hate Westerners simultaneously. The negative experiences of the Ottoman past would assumingly be left behind if Turkey completed its Westernization process. However, whenever Westerners/Europeans questioned the credentials of Turkey’s Western identity, the dominant view on the part of the majority of Turks happened to be that Westerners did never and would never recognize Turkey as Western/European. For example, the reluctance of Europeans to admit Turkey to EU membership has generally been interpreted as the continuation of the traditional European attitude towards Turkey, according to which Turks have been among the constitutive others of Europeans."

      "E": "It is based on the idea that states are independent"
    },
    "explanation": "<strong>Ataturk’s Legacy </strong><br/>To Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Republic, and his comrades in arms, Turkey’s number one national interest during the 1920s and 1930s was to protect the newly gained independence and sovereignty as well as successfully completing the radical transformation process at home (Hale, 2013, 31055). This required the pursuit of a pragmatic, prudent and realist foreign policy, enshrining the principle of ‘peace at home peace in the world’. Turkish rulers tried to help bring into existence a stable and cooperative regional environment so that developments outside the borders would never have negative consequences on the ongoing modernization and development processes at home. In this sense, there seems to exist a strong degree of continuity between Turkey’s efforts to support regional cooperation during the interwar years through the Balkan Entente and Saadabad Pact and the attempts of the Justice and Development Party governments at encouraging regional cooperation initiatives over the last fifteen years.<br/>Pragmatism also suggested that Turkey would do well to construct friendly relations with former enemies. Involvement in the internal affairs of other states and pursuit of expansionist and irredentist foreign policies do not hold any place in Ataturk’s diplomatic legacy. This is the main reason why any attempt at regime change abroad is very much criticized at home. Traditional Turkish diplomacy is based on the idea that states are independent in their internal affairs and Turkey should not be involved in the business of regime change or value promotion. Trying to solve national security problems through diplomacy and international law is another legacy of Ataturk. The revision of the Lausanne regulations on the status of Turkish Straits through the Montreux Convention in 1936, the incorporation of Hatay region into Turkey in 1939, and the settlement of the Mousul question and the border dispute with Iraq in 1926 are all examples to the use of international law and diplomacy in Turkish foreign policy. Diplomacy backed by hard power capability and diplomatic initiatives conferring legitimacy on military victories constitute the backbone of Ataturk’s diplomatic legacy."

      "E": "Depiction of Turkey as a ‘bridge’ by Westerners does not relate to Turkey’s geographical location"
    },
    "explanation": "<strong>Geography is the Destiny </strong><br/>Turkey’s geographical location has always been the most important leverage in Turkey’s relations with other countries. Despite the danger of exaggerating ‘geographical determinism’, it would not be wrong to argue that Turkey’s diplomatic relations and foreign policy record during much of the Republican era have been deeply informed by Turkey’s geography (Aydin, 2003, 163-184). Turkey’s geography has been both an asset and liability. Turkey’s decision to join NATO as well as being in the crosshairs of global powers can be convincingly attributed to its geographical location. Being located at the intersection point of three continents, Turkey has continuously attracted the attention of other countries, notably the great powers which have had vital security interests in Turkey’s regional environment.<br/>The United States defined Turkey as the unsinkable aircraft carrier during the Cold War. The Soviet Union wanted to get control of the straits and eastern part of Anatolia in the immediate aftermath of the World War II and this prompted Turkey to seek security cooperation with the United States. Turkey joined NATO in 1952 to deal with the Soviet challenge much better. Turkey’s efforts to become an energy hub during the post-Cold War era are noticeable. In its effort to convince the Europeans to the idea of Turkey’s membership in the European Union, Turkish rulers have continuously instrumentalized Turkey’s geographical location as a bargaining chip. Turkey’s geography has recently come to the agenda in the context of the migration crisis engulfing European countries. The migration deal that Turkey signed with the European Union in the spring of 2016 is very much the function of Turkey’s peculiar geography in the context of European efforts to stem the refugee flow emanating from the Greater Middle Eastern region. The main reason why the island of Cyprus occupies a very important place in Turkish foreign policy is Cyprus’s geographical proximity to Anatolian peninsula as well as the recent discovery of rich natural gas resources in Eastern Mediterranean.<br/>The reason why Europeans could not easily give up on Turkey can also be boiled down to Turkey’s potential contribution to European security. Hence, Turkey is mainly characterized as a buffer-zone and insulator country by Europeans. Underlining Turkey’s potential contribution to the protection of the Kantian security environment inside the EU against the security challenges emanating from the Hobbesian security environment in the Middle East has decisively colored Turkey’s discourse with Western/European countries. Depiction of Turkey as a ‘bridge’ and ‘role model’ by Westerners does also relate to Turkey’s geographical location.<br/>Turkey’s geography does also suggest that Turkey should always be alerted to potential threats posed to its security as well as maintaining strong and credible armed forces. Of all the reasons of military’s key role in Turkish diplomacy, the need to have a powerful army in this fragile and delicate geographical location proves to be decisive."

      "D": "Turkey has followed a more multi-directional and multi-dimensional foreign policy stance",
      "E": "Turkey tried to strike a balance between a more independent/multidirectional foreign policy stance"
    },
    "explanation": "During the Second World War, Turkey continued the multi-directional foreign policy stance of the interwar period and pursued the so-called active neutrality foreign policy (Vanderlippe, 2003, 63-80). Rather than siding with one side of the warring parties, Turkey tried to benefit from the geopolitical rivalries between the axis powers on the one hand and the allied countries on the other.<br/>The time period between 1945 and 1960 corresponds to a bipolar international structure and a high level confrontation between the US-led Western liberal democratic countries and the communist countries of the Soviet block. Turkey felt itself under Soviet threat and wanted to join the Western international community in such a way to counterbalance the existential threat to the north. Following its admission to NATO and given the increasing tension between the two power blocks, Turkey had to pursue a predominantly pro-Western foreign policy course. The rigid atmosphere of the early Cold War years did not offer Turkey the ability to adopt neutrality and pursue an independent/non-aligned foreign policy course. Turkey’s maneuvering capability was extremely limited during this era.<br/>For about twenty years between 1960 and 1980, Turkey shifted to a more multi-directional and multi-dimensional foreign policy stance as the so-called détente caused a softening of the bipolar confrontation between Western and eastern blocks (Hale, 2013, 104-134). Turkish rulers came to the conclusion that the pursuit of extremely pro- Western foreign policy stance of the previous era did not yield expected benefits. As the United States and the Soviet Union began to search for ways to live in peaceful co-existence, Turkey felt more capable of charting its own ways through regional activism.<br/>During the 1980s, Turkey had to discover the importance of the strategic relations with the Western world once again as the change of regime Iran and the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan increased the tension between the two blocks. The second arrival of the Cold War era confrontation helped increase Turkey’s geopolitical significance in Western eyes. During the 1980s, Turkey predominantly followed a pro-Western foreign policy stance despite the emergence of some problems in relations with Western countries. Turkey’s maneuvering capability in its foreign policy radically improved with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. No longer feeling the pressure to the north, Turkey could pursue active and assertive policies in the Balkans, Caucasus, Central Asia and Middle East. Even though the evaporation of the Soviet threat contributed to the erosion of the strategic bond between Turkey and its Western allies, membership in NATO and the prospective membership in European Union preserved their primacy in Turkey’s strategic thinking. The pro-Western stance in Turkish foreign policy was also enabled by the US-led unipolar structure of the international system, the growing appeal of the constitutive norms of the Western international community as well as the perception of Turkey in the West as a successful role model for the countries that regained their independence in the post-Soviet geography. The 1990s could be seen as a period in which Turkey tried to strike a balance between pursuing a more independent/multidirectional foreign policy stance on the one hand and increasing its efforts to solidify its presence in the Western international community on the other. While the end of the Cold War seems to have increased Turkey’s maneuvering capability, the gradual erosion of Turkey’s strategic value in the eyes of Western/European allies absent the common communism threat pushed Turkish leaders to help reassert Turkey’s Western/European identity through NATO and the European Union.<br/>The shift to a more multipolar system over the last decade, particularly following the global financial crisis in 2008, and the spectacular increase in Turkey’s material power capabilities seem to have encouraged Turkish rulers to follow a more multi-directional and multi-dimensional foreign policy stance. During this era, Turkey has been in search for more strategic autonomy (Öniş and Yılmaz, 2009, 7-24). The relative decline of Western powers, the questioning of the Western model across the globe, the concomitant rise of non-Western powers in global politics and the onset of the Arab Spring seem to have all caused a shift of axis in Turkish foreign policy away from the West to the East. Turkey acting as a ‘central country’ and pursuing a ‘Eurasianist’ foreign policy stance became quite visible during this era."

In its effort to convince the Europeans to the idea of Turkey’s membership in the European Union, Turkish rulers have continuously instrumentalized Turkey’s geographical location as a bargaining chip."

Contrary to the ‘hegemonic stability theory’, the US does not want to play the role of benign hegemon any longer. As for the relations with traditional allies, the key message the United States is now sending is that those allies should spend more on their security and defense. They should not take the American commitment to their security for granted. European allies should both speed up their integration process within EU and contribute more strategic and military capabilities to NATO (Haas, 2017, 2-9). Dealing with the challenges arising from the resurgent Russia, instability in the Balkans and the growing anarchy in the Middle East and North Africa is first and foremost the responsibility of European allies. What happens in these locations affect Europe more than the U.S. It is now abundantly clear that that the U.S. does not want to channel too much of its attention and capabilities to European and Middle Eastern security challenges. Rather, it would like to see its European allies pay much of the bill in such theatres. With Obama and Trump, the focus on great power relations came back.

Unlike the developed western economies which are built on the capitalist values, Russian economy very much relies on the export of commodities in a semi-close economy, such as gas and oil. Unlike the Chinese model in which capitalist modernization process could go hand in hand with authoritarian state policies, Russia offers a particular example of illiberal societies in which the state is extremely involved in economics, social and political life."

In case interests dominate foreign policy choices and behaviors of actors, states are mainly motivated in their external relations by the concern of maximizing their material power capabilities as well as ensuring their long-term survival. Here, neither internal characteristics at home nor the way how other states are ruled in their domestic affairs has a role in shaping foreign policy.

The so-called neo-classical realist approach in International Relations can for example be interpreted as a scholarly attempt at successfully merging the tangible and intangible motivations of states’ foreign policy behaviors (Lobell, Ripsman and Taliaferro, 2009).

Their success in ensuring survival hinges on their ability to play global powers off against each other, viz. external balancing, rather than solely investing in their own material capabilities, viz. internal balancing (Goodby, 2014, 31-39). Their foreign policy behaviors aim primarily at mitigating the negative consequences of global power competitions on their internal stability and external sovereignty.

    },
    "explanation": "On the other hand, global powers are in a much better position than middle and small-sized powers to ground their foreign policies on the basis of both tangible interests and intangible values. The immense material power capabilities at their disposal empower them in their attempts at shaping the external milieu, rather than merely responding to external stimuli in a reactionary manner. That is also to say that adopting a soft-power oriented foreign policy approach is likely to be the prerogative of strong global powers. Investing in value projection abroad and relying on ‘power of attraction’ in dealing with others indirectly require a good deal of hard power capability. Global powers do not only feel secure in terms of their territorial integrity but also find it easy to parley their immense material power capabilities to value-oriented transformative policies abroad.<br/>Unlike some middle powers and many small-sized powers, global powers have the luxury of helping bring into existence a particular external environment to their liking, as well as making use of the existing power balances within the system to maximize their material power capabilities. Stated somewhat differently, global powers do not only aim at maximizing their power capabilities at the expense of their rivals but also endeavor to midwife a particular external environment that reflects their values and norms (Mearsheimer, 2003)."

    "explanation": "The financial crisis that hit western economies in 2008 severely seems to have turned all such western assumptions upside down. The economic crisis in 2008 has not only weakened the specter of the EU to become a global power, both in economic and normative senses, but also made it abundantly clear that the success of the American economic model has been to a significant extent tied to the interdependent economic relations developed with the non-western world, most notably China. The crisis and its aftermath have made it unavoidably clear that the United States is today the most indebted country on earth whereas China the number one creditor country. Besides, majorities across the globe seem to believe that China, the aspiring hegemon, is on the rise whereas the United States, the incumbent hegemon, in terminal decline.<br/>Whereas China deems its phenomenal rise as part of its normalization process, the United States finds in China a strong contender for its global hegemony. While Chinese see their country’s efforts to leave behind the ‘centuries of humiliation’ for good as China’s rightful return to its glorious days, the majority of westerners tend to feel skeptical about the end results of this process. To many Chinese, China had been the cradle of global politics for ages by the time the western European nations eclipsed China in terms of economic output, technological innovations and military capabilities. By the middle of the 19<sup>th </sup>century, nearly half of global economic production had originated from China. Therefore, the Chinese believe that their country’s rise in recent decades should not be interpreted as the success story of an ordinary country climbing up the ladder of power. Instead, Chinese share the view that China’s recent successes are manifestations of China’s normalization and returning to world history as a major power (Xiang, 2016, 53-62)."

Recently, Russia has come under international limelight once again following its annexation of Crimea into its territory, the support that it gives to the separatist groups in the eastern part of Ukraine and its military involvement in Syria on the side of Assad regime. Hardly a day passes without Russia being criticized by western circles of pursuing aggressive, assertive and neo-imperial policies in its near-abroad. The major criticism directed to Russia is that unlike the post-modern powers of the European Union and the liberal power the United States, Russia acts as a typical realpolitik power which deeply believes in the primacy of material power capabilities, the use of brute military force and commanding spheres of influence in global power politics. Russia is believed to have been acting as a nineteenth century power in the twenty-first century."

    "explanation": "It is believed that Russian society is built on the primacy of patriarchal and communal values instead of self-regarding individualistic morality. Russian society evinces a predisposition to communitarian ethics over individualistic or cosmopolitan ethics. That is to say that the meaning of life of an ordinary Russian emanates from his/her belonging to the larger Russian community in which common societal values take priority over an individual quest for happiness and well-being. This perspective in Russian thinking seems to lay behind the objections to western notions of tolerance and heterogeneity. A completely secular culture in which people of different sex, faith, ethnicity, sexual preferences, and languages are completely equal before the law and the primary role of the state is to ensure this heterogeneity is something unacceptable in Putin’s Russia."

The negotiations between the parties were initiated once again in early 2008, yet the failure of the process triggered a heavy assault by the government forces on Tamil Tigers in early 2009. In May 2009, the government declared victory and Tigers admitted the defeat. Later, it was understood that the government of Sri Lanka was actually using the negotiation process which was relatively calm and peaceful to prepare for a final attack to defeat the Tigers decisively and annihilate the organization.

    "explanation": "Mediation initiatives has contributed to the construction of peace agreements, peaceful solution of several disputes or prevented potential crises to turn into violent conflicts. Yet, it should also be emphasized that mediation is also used as an instrument by the initiator to construct an international role. The initiator country or organization for mediation sometimes does so to have a say in world politics. Role theory of Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA) literature suggests that countries build certain national roles for themselves and conduct their foreign policy accordingly (Holsti 1970; Walker 1987). In this regard, we can see that there are certain countries in contemporary world politics which construct themselves as natural mediators in crisis situations. For instance, Norway has played mediator role in several disputes and its capital Oslo has been home to several peace talks such as the one between Israel and Palestine. Within this context, it is fair to suggest that mediator party also utilizes from the success of its potential mediation. In another case, for instance, Canada played a significant role in the gathering of Ottawa Convention on Ban on Land Mines (Anderson 2000). As a medium sized state, Canada has opened itself a space in world politics by initiating such an important process which turned into a binding agreement for more than 140 countries. Small states also take initiative to mediate in international or domestic crises. For instance, Switzerland as a “neutral country” for more than 600 years (Kriesi and Trechsel 2008), offered mediation to Spanish and Catalonian parties after emergence of crisis following the independence referendum in Catalonia in 2017. Another good example of small state mediation is the initiative of Algeria in the settlement of Iranian Hostage Crisis in 1979 (Slim, 1992: 206). We can mention two main types of mediation: formal and informal (Berkovich and Jackson, 1997). Formal mediation processes start after the authorization of a person by usually an international organization. In formal mediation processes, the mandate and jurisdiction of the mediator are determined in the authorization resolution. In such formal mediation practices, most of the procedural details of the mediation process are predefined."

The negotiations between the parties were initiated once again in early 2008, yet the failure of the process triggered a heavy assault by the government forces on Tamil Tigers in early 2009. In May 2009, the government declared victory and Tigers admitted the defeat. Later, it was understood that the government of Sri Lanka was actually using the negotiation process which was relatively calm and peaceful to prepare for a final attack to defeat the Tigers decisively and annihilate the organization. In fact, it was clear that Sri Lankan army was mobilizing and preparing for the attack since a long time frame including the negotiation period."

    "explanation": "An example of a negotiation process which is used as a tactic to gain time is the talks between the government of Sri Lanka and Tamil Tigers (Weiss 2011). The fight between the government forces and Tamil Tigers, a secessionist guerrilla group, lasted more than two decades and caused thousands of casualties on both parties. The negotiations between the parties were initiated once again in early 2008, yet the failure of the process triggered a heavy assault by the government forces on Tamil Tigers in early 2009. In May 2009, the government declared victory and Tigers admitted the defeat. Later, it was understood that the government of Sri Lanka was actually using the negotiation process which was relatively calm and peaceful to prepare for a final attack to defeat the Tigers decisively and annihilate the organization. The correct answer is C."

    "explanation": "It should also be noted that sometimes states negotiate with political entities that they do not recognize as a sovereign state. Diplomatic negotiations with de facto states can be given examples of such interactions. For instance, the negotiations on sea borders between China and Taiwan are typical examples of this sort. Although China does not recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state, it did not form an obstacle for the Chinese government to contact the Taiwanese authorities directly within the context of negotiations (Saunders and Kastner 2009).

    "explanation": "Finally, international diplomatic negotiations can include an international organization and a specific state government. Acceptance to an international organization is a typical topic for such a negotiation. Another possible subject matter for such a negotiation can be focusing on a behavior of a government which is not welcomed by international community and the international organization would initiate a process to convince that government to commit certain internationally recognized standards or principles. The nuclear negotiations between the government of Iran and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is a good example for such a negotiation that took place between a government and an authorized international organization (Sebenius and Singh 2012).

After long talks and negotiations, in 2005, IRA was convinced to leave the guns and will continue to its actions only in legal political space. The correct answer is B."

    "explanation": "Thirdly, sometimes international diplomatic negotiations can be among non-state actors. Such negotiation processes usually take place after multiparty civil wars (Raeymaekers et al. 2008). Such civil wars appear in weak state structure, leave destructive consequences and cause to failed-state structures. In such fragile environments, several armed groups get engage in violent conflict to fill the power vacuum. Negotiation among them usually starts following the mediation initiative by a third party. In such negotiations, parties discuss how to share power in post-conflict state-building process. Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of the former combatants constitute a major topic in a negotiation process running among insurgency groups. Peace talks initiated by ECOWAS in Liberia and Sierra Leone after protracted civil wars can be considered as good examples of negotiation processes facilitated by an international organization for the insurgency groups to discuss power-sharing in the post-conflict term (Halistoprak 2015).

    "explanation": "What are the basic features of a mediation intervention? A giant in the mediation studies, Bercovitch goes beyond just proposing a definition and clarifies the eight characteristics of international mediation as follows (Bercovitch, 1992: 4-5):<br/>1. Mediation is an extension and continuation of the parties’ own conflict management efforts.<br/>2. Mediation involves the intervention of an individual, group or organization into a dispute between two or more actors.<br/>3. Mediation is a non-coercive, non-violent and ultimately nonbinding form of intervention.<br/>4. Mediation turns an original bilateral dispute into triadic interaction of some kind. By increasing the number of actors from two to three, mediation effects considerable structural changes and creates new focal points for an agreement.<br/>5. A mediator enters a dispute in order to affect, change, resolve, modify or influence it in some way.<br/>6. Mediators bring with them, consciously or otherwise, ideas, knowledge, resources and interests of their own or of the group or organization they represent. Mediators are often important actors with their own assumptions and agendas about the dispute in question. International mediators are both interested and concerned parties.<br/>7. Mediation is a voluntary form of intervention. This means the parties retain their control over the outcome (if not always the process) of their dispute, as well as their freedom to accept or reject mediation or mediator’s proposals.<br/>8. Mediation operates on an ad hoc basis only.<br/>The correct answer is E."

For instance, the set of negotiated legal documents under Schengen Agreement, which introduced a common visa regime among the EU countries and several partner countries can be considered as an example of this type. After a negotiation process, the member states to the European Union enforced this diplomatic agreement and committed to a common visa program. Later, Schengen Agreement and the visa regime regulated in it was enlarged in a manner to include several non-EU countries such as Switzerland and Norway. The correct answer is B."
