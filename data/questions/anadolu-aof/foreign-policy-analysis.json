As can be understood from the definition given, the correct answer is A. The definitions of the other terms as follows:\n Two-level Game: Actors engaging in foreign policy, often, have to manage the tensions that are creating a compressing effect on their priorities forcing them to play a two-level game. The politics of many international negotiations can usefully be conceived as a two-level game. At the national level, domestic groups pursue their interests by pressuring the government to adopt favorable policies, and politicians seek power by constructing coalitions among those groups. At the international level, national governments seek to maximize their own ability to satisfy domestic pressures, while minimizing the adverse consequences of foreign developments. Neither of the two games can be ignored by central decision-makers, so long as their countries remain interdependent, yet sovereign.\n Power is a concept that refers to the influence and control exercised by one nation over others. Power is both the means used and the goal sought by states in political, military, economic, and social competition with each other.\n Role Conception is defined as the perceptions of foreign policy makers’ on their nations’ position in the international system, its national interests and the key principles that allow it to defend them.\n The term “International Relations” refers to an academic discipline that focuses on the study of the interaction of the actors within the international system."

Under this traditional assumption these actors decide in consideration of all present alternatives, through a process that is focused on utility-maximization, while suffering minimum costs, in the best interest of the country and every effort is made to achieve the relevant information on the situation. This idea led to the understanding of the state as a blackbox - a unitary actor of internal differences of which, does not have any relevance pertaining to its foreign policy actions. In other words, regarding their foreign policies all states act upon a certain set of principles, affecting them in similar ways, which stem out of their ontology as states. Such an essentialist approach renders issues like; ideological or psychological predispositions of the decisionmakers, or differences of governmental systems, regime types, ideas or policymaking processes irrelevant.

    },
    "explanation": "As being one of the essential concepts in International Relations, anarchy alludes to the absence of government or the lack of a central authority within the framework of politics. Anarchy derives from the Greek word “anarkhos” which means “without a ruler”. Put simply, states as the dominant actors of international relations have no absolute control over international system. Since states are political entities that recognize no equal domestically and no superior externally there, is no central authority in international relations. This provides an international politics with its anarchical characteristics. Even though they concur on the nature of the international system as anarchic, major theories of international relations treat anarchy in different ways. For example, while neorealists are motivated to work within the limits anarchy imposes structurally on state behavior, neoliberals are striving to ameliorate its effects.\n As can be understood from the information given, the correct answer is B. Definitions of the other terms in the options are as follows:\n Agency: For proponents of a structural approach to international relations, approaches concentrating on unit (actor) level, with their strong focus on the states, are somehow reductionist. That is because, although states are dominant agencies with persuasive power over their peers and other agencies, and with ability to exert consequential, though not definitive, influence on the outcomes, state behavior in and of itself is not enough to analyze either the interaction amongst the actors or the abovementioned outcomes. Point is, the “actions of groups, when aggregated, produce patterns of behavior that may be fundamentally different from the behavior patterns of the individual” agency. “In this sense, the behavioral characteristics and the impact of behavioral patterns, or interactions, of the aggregate are greater than, and differentiated from, those of its individual parts.\n Interdependence: Interdependence implies that the increasing connectivity between the actors and issues led to a world where no actor is immune from the impact of what is happening to another. Interdependence is positively correlated with industrialization, modernization, and most importantly globalization.\n Sovereignty: Originating with the Peace of Westphalia, ending the 30 Years’ Wars, in 1648, sovereignty, or more properly state-sovereignty, is an externally, i.e. by other actors, recognized right of independent, supreme or final decision-making and decision-enforcing authority possessed by the state, generally over given territory.\n Milieu: Milieu represents the visible, more tangible and emotionally laden conceptualization for man’s environment."

Besides, contemporary literature argues that, “foreign policy, although usually linked to the behavior of a state, can apply to other actors.

Foreign policy inputs are those many factors that influence decision-making, whilst the observable outputs of foreign policy are a feature of state (and non-state) behavior within the international system.” (Smith, Hadfield, and Dunne, 2008, p.392) • “A set of actions or rules governing the actions of an independent political authority deployed in the international environment” (Morin and Paquin, 2018, p.3). • “Foreign policy in its traditional definition is the policy of a state towards external actors and especially other states. In contrast particularly to neorealism, it therefore does not primarily look at the international system as such but offers an ‘inside-out’ perspective to understand the decisionmaking process within a state that produces policies directed beyond the state.” (Diez, Bode, and Costa, 2011, p. 58) • “The totality of a country’s policies toward and interactions with the environment beyond its borders” (Breuning, 2007, p.180). • “The totality whereby state actors act, react and interact. Foreign policy has been termed a boundary activity. The term ‘boundary’ implies that those making policy straddle two environments: an internal or domestic environment and an external or global environment. The policy makers and the policy system stand therefore at these junction points and seek to mediate between the various milieu.” (Evans and Newnham, 1998, p. 179) • “Foreign policy is seen usually as the quintessential ‘boundary’ activity, at the interface between the domestic and the external spheres. While these spheres have never been completely separate, the boundary between them seems to have become more porous as a result of globalization - a multidimensional contested process that involves an increasing embedding of political, military, economic, social and cultural activities in politically unified (quasi) global spheres of activity.” (Alden and Aran, 2017, p.107)\n The correct answer is E."

Waltz’s three images of international relations meant denote for the three possible sources of war in international relations because Waltz refers to the three levels of analysis as “images”. In that he explained sources of international behavior, (manifested as foreign policy) in human nature (first image), organizations and structures of the state and struggles among domestic actors (second image), in the structure of the international system, relationships among states and groups of states, alliances etc. (third image). He essentially underrated the explanatory power of the first and second images and concentrated on the third as the main level of analysis to understand causes of war, and international relations as such. As it focused on the systemic sources Waltz’s argument is structural."

Interdependence is positively correlated with industrialization, modernization, and most importantly globalization. It is used to describe a new phase in international relations where states were becoming increasingly interdependent on a vast variety of issues. In other words, as the complexity and global characteristics of problems increased, so did the need for globally coordinated efforts for solutions. This strengthened not only the interrelatedness of issues but also the interdependency of the actors. This is because the vulnerabilities of the states to these problems were on the rise, while, the ability of states to individually influence the global outcomes were decreasing. The increasing interrelatedness of issues means that independent of wherever on the globe they might be taking place they have profound potential affects on the states. It is an environment where ‘global problems needed global solutions’. These issues encompassed economy, climate change and migration to name a few."

Anarchy derives from the Greek word “anarkhos” which means “without a ruler”. Put simply, states as the dominant actors of international relations have no absolute control over international system. Since states are political entities that recognize no equal domestically and no superior externally there, is no central authority in international relations. This provides an international politics with its anarchical characteristics. Even though they concur on the nature of the international system as anarchic, major theories of international relations treat anarchy in different ways. For example, while neorealists are motivated to work within the limits anarchy imposes structurally on state behavior, neoliberals are striving to ameliorate its effects."

    "explanation": "Before FPA analysis has developed as a discipline, it was still an area widely studied within IR. Thus, the traditional theories of IR, namely idealism and realism, also have inquiries about foreign policy. They base their explanation of foreign policy on systemic factors, that is they believe foreign policy decisions are influenced by the nature of the international system. While doing this, both idealism and realism attribute features of human nature to the states. This methodology is defined as rational-choice theory, which assumes a unified decision-making body in the form of the state, as well as a belief that the pursuit of self-interest guided all decision makers (Alden and Aran, 2017, 6). The correct answer is D."

Therefore, according to the realist theory, the way to prevent wars was not moral values or international institutions but balance of power in the international system. Although the state is the main actor in realist theory, it is also attributed features from human nature. But human nature does not have positive connotations like it has in the idealist theories.

According to this approach, “events could be compared along behavioural dimensions, such as whether positive or negative affect was being displayed, or what instruments of statecraft (e.g., diplomatic, military, economics, etc.) were used in the influence attempt, or what level of commitment of resources was evident”, and thus behaviour as disparate as a war, a treaty, and a state visit can be compared and aggregated in a theoretically meaningful fashion (Hudson, 2014, 21).

Trying to make sense of foreign policies of states requires an in-depth analysis of the factors that play a role in this process. Of such factors, individual, internal, and external factors stand out the most. Whether the particular characteristics of leaders, state-societal level factors or externalsystemic factors play the most decisive role in this regard is a time-tested research question in the literature.\n<br/>The academic debate on the factors determining foreign policy is quite similar to the discussion on the level of analysis. Each particular level is a lens through which analysts try to make sense of foreign policy decisions of countries. Another way of contextualizing this debate is to focus on alternative images in international relations. Kenneth Walzt, one of the founding fathers of modern International Relations discipline, argues that there exist three images in international relations, which are first, second and third images (Waltz, 1954). These images correspond to the three levels. First image is about the leaders and statesmen who are in charge of their countries. According to this view, foreign policy should be examined from the perspective of statesmen because foreign policy is a high politics activity immune to the infiltration of societal factors. The public itself should be kept outside of analysis because dealing with foreign policy and taking foreign policy decisions requires expertize and state-level secrecy. Second image is about the state-society level factors, whereas the third image is very much about the impact of international systemic factors on foreign policy. Whereas the first and second images are very much inside-out perspectives, the third image is very much about outside-in analysis. The question to be answered in this context is on the basis of which level of analysis we can make sense of foreign policy decisions of states.\n<br/>As also understood from the information given, all of the statements related to the three images in international relations corresponding to the three levels argued by Kenneth Waltz, one of the founding fathers of modern International Relations discipline are correct, so the answer is E."

    "explanation": "The academic literature on foreign policy analysis is replete with different theoretical accounts, each of which tries to make sense of foreign policy decision from a different perspective (Smith, Hadfield and Dunne, 2012). Classical realism puts the main emphasize on individual factors and prioritizes the role of leaders and statesmen in the formulation and conduct of foreign policy decisions. Statesmen represent their countries and approach foreign policy from power perspective. Similar to individuals, states are interested in survival, security and having influence on the choices of other states. The human nature is bad and greedy and states try to maximize their power capabilities to survive in the conflictual international environment. Though classical realists give credit to the role of morality in foreign policy, the way how they define morality in interstate relations radically differs from the understanding of morality as applied to interpersonal relations. Any particular foreign policy action would be deemed as moral so long as it serves to the survival, security and power needs of states (Ersoy, 2014, 166-172).\n<br/>Liberal pluralist perspective values the role of societal and intra-state level factors in foreign policy analysis. States are not unitary actors and their internal characteristics would decisively shape their foreign policy preferences and actions (Jackson and Sorenson, 2003, 105-137).\n<br/>Structural realism does on the other hand single out distribution of material power capabilities among states and the anarchical structure of international system as the most important explanatory factor in this regard and turns a blind eye to the potential impact of individual and internal factors on foreign policy (Waltz, 1979). External factors as they are defined within the context of international system are more influential in shaping foreign policy preferences and actions. Assuming that states are black boxes, neorealism assumes that all states, irrespective of their internal differences, put survival, territorial security and power maximization at the center of their foreign policies. Put another way, states would respond to external stimuli in similar ways. The anarchical structure of international environment would suggest that states have to pursue self-help security and foreign policy strategies.\n<br/>As also understood from the information given, all of the statements in the options related to the theories of foreign policy are correct, so the answer is E."

Both the organizational behavior and the bureaucratic politics models suggest that the state should not be considered as a unitary actor with one single predominant leader holding monopoly over national foreign policy issues. As also understood from the information given, the answer is A.\n<br/>Rational Actor model assumes that leaders act rationally in foreign policy. States are considered to be unitary actors behaving rationally in their relations with other international actors (Neack, 2008, 31-39). Rationality suggests that leaders undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the particular courses of action available to themselves and picks the one that would yield the highest amount of benefit and least amount of cost. Leaders make a preference ordering based on the expected payoffs of available courses of action. Stated somewhat differently, exposed to a particular foreign policy problem, leaders enumerate all alternative courses of action and choose the most beneficial one. This approach also holds out that leaders have full knowledge of the foreign policy environment that surrounds them and their emotions, feelings, beliefs, etc., are left outside the picture. In other words, leaders are supposed to be well informed about the dynamics of the problem at hand, the position of other parties, the instruments available to them as well as all facilitating and constraining factors. Foreign policy strategy concerns the search for most optimum ways through which states would materialize their foreign policy goals/ ends by dint of available means/instruments at hand.\n<br/>However, the so-called cognitive school of thought, which has become increasingly important in theoretical discussions on foreign policy in recent decades, argues that leaders/individuals are not always as rational as they are assumed to be. Some psychological and sociological factors appear to limit their ability to act rationally (Neack, 2008, 47-64). Leaders tend to view the external environment through their subjective perceptions and the amount of information available to them at a given moment. They might not be able to assess the external environment as it is, since they might lack the full knowledge of the environment and their assessment might be built on their perception of the reality. How they perceive the external reality shapes the limits of their rationality. Stated somewhat differently, there is no objective external reality outside their personal perceptions. And the way how they pursue the environment might be informed by their individual baggage, which consists of, among others, their emotions, past experiences, belief systems, world views, cognitive shortcuts, ideologies and personal traits."

The pressure of group thinking is a very important psychological restraint affecting the rationality of individuals.\n<br/>The tendency to refer to historical analogies and apply cognitive shortcuts is another factor that appears to constrain rationality. We most of the time tend to interpret the current developments.\n<br/>Leaders might also think that they, the countries they lead, represent the good whereas others the bad. This is what is called in the literature as attribution bias. If something positive happens in their foreign policy contributing to the national interests of their countries, they tend to think this is because of their good intentions and benevolent policies. If something negative happens in the context of their national interests, they tend to attribute the main reason to the bad intentions and evil character of others. Rather than taking responsibility for the negative consequences of their actions, they prefer to put the blame on the shoulders of others. The sources of attributing good to themselves and bad to others might emanate from strong religious belief.\n<br/>Another psychological factor that might curtail their ability to act rationally is cognitive dissonance. Leaders might hold particular world views and belief systems and these might shape their foreign policy preferences and behaviors decisively. They might be predisposed to interpret the external stimuli in such a way that corresponds and validates their previously held beliefs. Whenever they are exposed to some signals that contradict their previously held world views and belief systems they might tend to ignore them, most of the time at the peril of the national interests of their countries defined rationally. This also suggests that they would likely interpret the particular external signals that are in accordance with their well-established world view and belief systems as evidences of the rightness and appropriateness of their foreign policy behaviors.\n<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

    "explanation": "Recommended Revision\n<br/>Page 87\n<br/>Here, internal characteristics of states as well as personal attributes of decision makers are <strong>drooped out</strong> from analysis.\n<br/>Here, internal characteristics of states as well as personal attributes of decision makers are <strong>dropped out</strong> from analysis.<br/>Foreign policy analysis as an academic discipline examines how states, the main actors of international relations, respond to external developments and engage with other actors (Neack, 2008). Trying to make sense of foreign policies of states requires an in-depth analysis of the factors that play a role in this process. Of such factors, individual, internal, and external factors stand out the most.\n<br/>The third set of factors that might help analysts make sense of foreign policy of states is external factors. Focusing on external factors is mostly emphasized by realist and structural realist scholars in International Relations. Here, internal characteristics of states as well as personal attributes of decision makers are dropped out from analysis. What matter in this context are the dynamics of international systemic environment, distribution of material power capabilities among states, geographical location of states and the nature of the terrain on which states are located (Aydin, 1999, 152-186). These are the attributes of the system.\n<br/>The dynamics of international systemic environment are quite important in this context. Depending on the nature of polarity within the system, foreign policy tools available to states would vary. States’ maneuvering capability within the system would be closely linked with distribution of power capabilities among states. Whether states pursue more assertive and active foreign policies or feel extremely constrained in their foreign policy behaviors would mainly be a function of the nature of polarity at systemic and regional levels as well as how material power capabilities are distributed among states. Unipolar, bipolar and multipolar systems would suggest different foreign policy behaviors. Different polarity configurations affect foreign policies of great, middle and small powers differently (Breuning, 2007, 141-162).\n<br/>Power distribution is also important for another reason. The literature on foreign policy analysis is replete with studies that contend that global/ super powers, middle/medium-sized powers and small-sized power would behave differently in their foreign policy. These are all identity related categorizations and suggest different foreign policy thoughts and foreign policy tools to be employed. Power differences among states would have a decisive impact on their ability to set the rules of international relations in their favor, to help transform other states in the image of their values and norms, to pursue global or regional leadership, to shape the regional environment in which they live and finally to resist the demands of other states. Even though the distribution of material power capabilities among states would put them into different power categories, such as global, middle level or small-sized countries, these labels also suggest different foreign policy roles. The kind of foreign policy roles and behaviors that one expects major powers to embrace would be different from the foreign policy roles and behaviors that less powerful states might adopt (Haas, 2014, 715-753).\n<br/>Geographical location is another factor emphasized by the ones who focus on external factors in explaining foreign policy of states (Aydın, 2003, 163-184). The first point to underline in this regard is the number of neighbors states have. Should states neighbor with many states, they would be more predisposed to prioritize territorial security concerns. States with multiple neighbors do generally suffer from the infamous siege mentality thinking that they are all surrounded by enemies that covet their territory. Such states would generally hold their neighbors accountable for whatgoes wrong in their foreign policies. Neighbors would be the usual suspect for anything that could potentially affect regional security environment negative. States with multiple neighbors would likely feel alerted against the intentions of others and be more inclined to devote their financial assets to military armament. The degree of internal factors determining foreign policy choices and behaviors of states with multiple neighbors would be extremely low. Foreign policy of such states can therefore be defined as their responses to external stimuli.\n<br/>Geographical location and the nature of the terrain on which countries are located are also important in the sense of preparing war plans. Should a country sit on a plain landmass with no highs, it would spend money to improve its defense capabilities as well as tend to be extremely vigilant towards its neighbors.\n<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is D. What matter in this context are the dynamics of international systemic environment, distribution of material power capabilities among states, geographical location of states and the nature of the terrain on which states are located. Strategic culture is among the internal factors. Strategic cultures of states do also matter in their foreign policy choices and behaviors (Johnston, 1995, 32-64). This culture is transmitted from one generation to another through education and other socialization processes. Past experiences of wars with others as well as how threats and the means adopted to deal with them were defined in the past decisively shape the contemporary security practices of state. Whether states today prioritize neutrality, isolationism, internationalization, alliance formation or collective security practices is to a significant extent informed by their historical experiences."

Countries which are located by the sea would have different foreign policy priorities than countries which do not have maritime borders or are totally land-locked. Land powers would likely prioritize spending on their army whereas maritime powers would spend their financial resources more on navy and marine/coastguard forces than land forces. Land powers, compared to maritime powers, would be more preoccupied with concerns over territorial security and survival.\n<br/>Third, the importance of geographical location also manifests itself in the sense of states leveraging their particular geographical features in their foreign relations. Some states, such as Turkey, lie at the intersection of different regions and continental landmasses and this gives them immense bargaining power with third parties. In the context of transporting gas and oil resources of Central Asian, Middle Eastern and Caucasian regions to western European markets, Turkey can act as a transit country. Geographical location can also incur negative consequences in the sense of states being the target of other countries. Holding a key, a geographical location like Turkey might attract the malign intentions of other states. It is quite well known that Turkey was a part of the geopolitical confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union owing to its geographical location. Americans saw Turkey as an unsinkable aircraft carrier in the context of its efforts to contain the Soviet influence in the Balkans, Black Sea, Caucasus and Middle East regions. Similarly, Russians tend to view Turkey as a key country in their historical efforts to reach out to the hot waters in the Mediterranean. That Turkey possesses the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits caused great tension in Turkey’s relations with Russia in the past.\n<br/>As also understood from the information given, the answer is E.

According to this view, foreign policy should be examined from the perspective of statesmen because foreign policy is a high politics activity immune to the infiltration of societal factors. The public itself should be kept outside analysis because dealing with foreign policy and taking foreign policy decisions requires expertize and state-level secrecy. Internal factors are about the role of state-society level inputs in the formation of foreign policy preferences. Internal factors are regime type, political ideologies, national role conceptualizations and geopolitical imaginations, strategic culture, interest groups, public opinion and media. External factors concern the impact of systemic level factors, both at regional and international level, in the formation of foreign policy preferences. Systemic factors are distribution of material power capabilities among states, polarity, geographical location and the nature of the terrain on which states are located.

The pressure of group thinking is a very important psychological restraint affecting the rationality of individuals.\n The tendency to refer to historical analogies and apply cognitive shortcuts is another factor that appears to constrain rationality.\n Leaders might also think that they, the countries they lead, represent the good whereas others the bad. This is what is called in the literature as attribution bias. If something positive happens in their foreign policy contributing to the national interests of their countries, they tend to think this is because of their good intentions and benevolent policies. If something negative happens in the context of their national interests, they tend to attribute the main reason to the bad intentions and evil character of others.\n Thus, the correct answer is D."

    "explanation": "Fundamentally the assumption about rationality of the decision-makers is that they act upon objective data and prefer a formal process of analysis to intuition and subjectivity. Ideally, the model also assumes that the decision maker has full or perfect information (a state where all data germane to a particular issue, decision, is known and available) on the circumstances of the situation and about the alternatives available. In his seminal book on decision processes, Graham Allison (1971, p.30) prescribes rationality as “consistent, value-maximizing choice within specific constrains”. The decision-makers are portrayed as individuals with the cognitive ability, and resources to evaluate and compare alternatives in the available time frame with the ultimate aim of maximizing utility and minimizing associated costs. So, rational decision makers on foreign policy are “those who are open to arguments and evidence, free of serious blinkers as they weigh the evidence and think about the likely consequences of options” (Stein, 2008, 131). A litmus test of what constitutes a rationally reached decision is that, ideally, when presented with identical information, all rational decision makers would arrive to the same conclusion for the decision in question. A logical deduction from the foregoing conjecture is that collective decision making processes should be favored as due to the deliberative nature and inherent checks and balances involved they would often tend to generate rational outcomes. What is more, not all decisions are taken under perfect information, and there are psychological and intellectual limits of human beings. These limitations, coupled with the human tendencies like the desire to simplify the world, taking shortcuts, the difficulties of processing complex sets of variables in mind simultaneously, especially when we are faced with a situation that fall beyond our expertise - and at times even on issues that we hold a certain expertise on, creates a decision environment where perfectly rational decision making is not possible. As a result, people tend to consent to “satisfice” themselves by sequentially analyzing the choices available until they find one that “meets their minimum standards of acceptability, one that will “suffice” and “satisfy” (Gerner, 1995, p.25). Policy makers do frequently ‘muddle through’ looking for outcomes that are the best available given the set of parameters they face. This phenomenon is defined as bounded rationality. The concepts of bounded rationality and “satisficing” were first developed by Herbert Simon (1965). Simon’s argument was that the decision-making problems were so complex that the decision-makers were only able to tackle a certain number of aspects at a given time. This makes reaching optimum estimations pretty hard. “It is impossible to consider all alternatives so policy-makers tend to consider the most obvious, most attainable, most reasonable, etc. Of course, as the actual decision process proceeds other alternatives may occur or originally conceived alternatives may disappear” (Evans and Newnham, 1998, p.464).\n<br/>As also understood from the information given, the assumptions in the option III “Not all decisions are taken under perfect information, and there are psychological and intellectual limits of human beings.”, in the option IV “Psychological and intellectual limits of human beings, coupled with the human tendencies create a decision environment where perfectly rational decision making is not possible.” and in the option V “People tend to consent to “satisfice” themselves by sequentially analyzing the choices available until they find one that “meets their minimum standards of acceptability, one that will “suffice” and “satisfy”.” are related to bounded rationality concept, so the correct answer is D.\n<br/>The assumptions in the option I “The decision-makers act upon objective data and prefer a formal process of analysis to intuition and subjectivity.” and “ The decision maker has full or perfect information on the circumstances of the situation and about the alternatives available.” are related to rationality."

    "explanation": "A common sense, colloquial definition of foreign policy decision-makers could be made as, units making decisions in the name of global political actors concerning their external environment. Apparently, it is not always an easy task to define who are the decision-makers. Especially in a democratic state, the decisions are usually taken as a result of a collective process based on collective deliberation. As a result, most foreign policy decisions could be viewed as taken by a group of individuals providing their ideas and insights, contributing their expertise and feedback and participating in the shaping of the outcome through a process of deliberation and negotiation. It is assumed that this process is characterized by rationality. As a result, the question and boundaries of whom the decision makers in foreign policy are shows variations in accordance with the internal and external factors pertaining to domestic political context.\n<br/>However, there are issues to be tackled with, as rationality is what decision-makers strive for, or more often than not a justifier of the accuracy of their decisions, than a standard that defines decision making processes. After all, political leaders are decision-makers that are human beings like the rest of us. Much like the rest of us, they suffer from cognitive biases that distorts their minds, leading to deviations in their perception and judgment of the situation from the reality of the challenge before them. They usually are as vulnerable to cognitive dissonances. Therefore, when they are left in a position that leaves them in between their long held ideas, beliefs and values and circumstances contradicting the said ideas, beliefs and values, they try to resolve it by adapting their perception of the situation rather than adopting their behavior to the reality of it. This could be done by either creating a new cognition of the reality they face by adding new parts or ignoring and denying information that leads to the dissonance etc. Also, decision-makers resort to heuristics, or more simply put “rules of thumb”, like the rest of us. Human brain is “hardwired to find patterns in complexity” and finds solace in avoiding it. It naturally prefers simple explanations to complex ones as “logic and deductive reasoning take a lot of energy” (Hudson, 2007, p. 42). This is an important reason why it is easy for the general public and nonspecialists to subscribe to conspiracy theories. All of these factors make decision-makers prone to become cognitive misers as often as the rest of us, clouding, destabilizing and faulting the decision-making processes on foreign policy. “Cognitive Miser” is a concept that refers to the tendency of human beings to avoid spending computational effort and resorting to facile ways in solving problems. This phenomena is accepted as a natural tendency that is had regardless of the level of intelligence of the person.\n<br/>As also understood from the information given, the arguments in the option II “Much like the rest of us, political leaders suffer from cognitive biases that distorts their minds, leading to deviations in their perception and judgment of the situation from the reality of the challenge before them.”, in the option III “Decision-makers resort to heuristics, or more simply put “rules of thumb”, like the rest of us.”, in the option IV “Human brain is “hardwired to find patterns in complexity” and finds solace in avoiding it. “ and in the option V “Human brain naturally prefers simple explanations to complex ones as “logic and deductive reasoning take a lot of energy” can be used by the one who has been explaining the cognitive miser concept, so the correct answer is E.\n<br/>The argument in the option I “The decision maker has full or perfect information (a state where all data germane to a particular issue, decision, is known and available) on the circumstances of the situation and about the alternatives available.” is related to the rationality concept."

    "explanation": "A famous quote generally attributed to American politician Thomas P. “Tip” O’Neill states that “All politics is local”. Undoubtedly the domestic political landscape does have a profound effect in shaping foreign policy. The strength of the government, the domestic political climate, the relations amongst political parties and between them and civil society have an important bearing on the decision making environment on foreign policy. After all, usually the most important element of decision-making process in foreign policy is the “political struggle and bargaining between groups” (Dougherty &amp; Pfaltzgraff, 1990, p. 477) within a given polity. The aim for all actors involved in this process is, “to maximize its interests, agendas, and goals”\n<br/>Apart from the impact of intertwined networks of relations between disparate groups with differing priorities, what complicates foreign policy decision making environment more is the impact of transnational actors on different elements of the society. Rosenau called this phenomenon “linkage politics”. Linkage politics is defined as “a recurrent sequence of behaviour that originates in one state and is reacted in another” (Rosenau, 1969, 45). Growing linkages between the international system and domestic environment, where foreign policy decisions are made, forces foreign policy analysts to re-examine the role of the state as the exclusive sentinel governing the relations of their own society with the rest of the world.\n<br/>As also understood from the information given, all factors in the options have an important bearing on the decision making environment on foreign policy, so the correct answer is E."

Emulative linkages happen when a development in one society is imitated by another. The events of the so-called Arab Spring that started in Tunis in 2010 quickly spreading to Libya, Egypt, and Syria are a case in point. Finally, James N. Rosenau points out to penetrative linkages. What he means here is deliberate attempts of elements of one society to influence and, at times, manipulate the other. Such attempts usually involve soft power and utilize means like public diplomacy, but might also include lobbying and propaganda activities. Some of the moves aimed at penetrative linkages are usually perceived by more nationalistic elements in the receiving society as hostile acts targeted towards manipulating and organizing the society and politics. The increasingly globalized nature of international relations creates an environment where there are myriad linkages across societies.\n As also understood from the information given, the correct matching of the linkages with the definitions, identified by James N.

    "explanation": "One can claim that it is noteworthy to explain the impact of domestic politics on foreign policy nexus the studies of James Rosenau (1966, 1967). His main contribution to the field by writing his famous pretheory article in 1966 was to see “the concept of issue area as a vertical boundary in politics” (Evans and Newnham, 1998, p.285). Issue area is a term used first by Robert Dahl (1961) as an important element of a political system, but Dahl has not defined the conception of issue-area in a definite way. As stated by Sher (1977, p.44), Dahl labeled three issue-areas “which were of relevance to governmental and nongovernmental leadership, these being urban development, education and nominations”. In this sense, James Rosenau has taken Dahl’s approaches to issue-area and took it one step further. For Rosenau, the conception of issue-area composed of “(i) a cluster of values, the allocation or potential allocation of which (ii) leads the affected or potentially affected actors to differ so greatly over (a) the way which the values should be allocated or (b) the horizontal levels at which the allocations should be authorized that (iii) they engage in distinctive behavior designed to mobilize support for the attainment of their particular values” (Rosenau, 1971, p.141). To put it simply, Rosenau proposed four issue areas in his seminal piece of pre-theory as territorial, status, human resources, and non-human resources.\n<br/>As also understood from the information given, the correct answer is C. “Territorial”, “Status”, “Human Resources” and “Non-human Resources” are four issue areas proposed by James N. Rosenau in the context of foreign policy analysis in his seminal piece of pre-theory. “Urban Development” is one of the issue areas, not defined the conception of issue-area in a definite way. As stated by Sher (1977, p.44), Dahl labeled three issue-areas “which were of relevance to governmental and nongovernmental leadership, these being urban development, education and nominations”."

Attentive public is a concept used to provide a framework for researches on public opinion. One can define attentive public as the “proportion of the people in mass society who hold articulate, informed and coherent attitudes about public policy issues” (Evans and Newnham, 1998, p. 38). As also understood from the information given, the concept defined as the “proportion of the people in mass society who hold articulate, informed and coherent attitudes about public policy issues, so the correct answer is E.\n The definitions for the other concepts in the options are as follows:\n Bureaucracy is any wide-reaching group of assigned officials in order to execute foreign policy decisions of the decision makers. The first usage of bureaucracy was when Max Weber (1864-1920) described the term as the most affective way to establish an organization and administration. Besides, its complex structure of offices, tasks, and rules shape bureaucracy as a large scale institution in order to coordinate the work of employees. In that vein, bureaucracy has a significant impact on foreign policy of which has become an important element of foreign policy literature by the 1960s. The role of the administrative structures of government on foreign policy decision making has become a key topic for the studies in that field. Within the scope of foreign policy, bureaucracy is viewed as a sort of synonym for governments which means a group of official individuals with different policy preferences.\n An interest group is a group of people who share out a common interest. Putting it differently, these are organized groups of individuals that have an attraction on governments when it comes to foreign policy decisions. Labor unions, lobby groups, important figures in business, religious groups might be viewed as interest groups and each of them has distinctive characteristic when it comes to their impacts on foreign policies in their countries. Most interest groups have a participation system in which they can easily get in touch with each other in order to fulfill their goals whatever these goals are. When they interact with governments, interest groups mostly do two main things. First, interest groups attempt to shape policies by mobilizing the voters or through the way of putting direct pressure on officials. Second, they sometimes prefer to gather information for officials when the need arises. Within this framework, it may be said that well-funded interest groups can provide too costly information to governments when bureaucrats are not enable to reach them.\n Pluralism is a term used to describe a political system which includes several different cultures, belief systems and lifestyles while working together by sharing common political aims within the framework of politics and tolerating each other in order to live together peacefully. As interest groups do, pressure groups also aim to influence governments, not take power themselves. For affecting governments, pressure groups are able to work in different environments with multiple variety of people through different ways like lobbying, media campaigning, and demonstrations. Within the scope of its multiple social environment of pressure groups, it may be said that the existence of pressure groups enhances pluralism in a society.\n It should be said from the start that the concept of public opinion may be defined in many ways within the framework of foreign policy. In other words, in the literature on public opinion there exists a variety of definitions. For example, Pierre Bourdieu has approached to public opinion as if there is no such a thing like that by saying that “public opinion does not exist” (1979:124)”. Apart from the discussion about its ontology, one can define the concept of public opinion as “the attitudes and opinions of the population of a society. It is often often measured by through the the use of surveys” (Breuning, 2007, p.183). What is the most arguable point on this subject is what is the best way of measuring public opinion and the jury is still out there. Though public opinion surveys conducted perpetually, as claimed by Morin and Paquin (2018, p.167), “the press only reports a tiny selection of polls” and decision makers in foreign policy kept constantly be informed with these poll results as if these are important elements of public opinion."

In cases of committing a serious crime unrelated with their diplomatic mission or witnessing such a crime, the immunity can be waived by the official’s home country. <br/>According to the principle of the reciprocity, all diplomats from any country in the world benefit equally from diplomatic immunity. Although Vienna Convention originally did not cover the staffs of international organizations, certain privileges for the international organizations’ staffs have been granted in time with the founding treaties of such organizations. For example, the UN and its agencies have standard implementations such as the UN laissez-passer and diplomatic immunity for the highest-ranking officials.<br/>Therefore, the correct option is B."

Accordingly , a specific criterion which is based on size, preparation and legitimation was formed to define such events as war. This definition excludes, unplanned, unorganized and nonlegitimized conflicts, such as riots, but on the other hand it includes large-scale civil wars which are ignored<br/>in the political perspective."

In an absolute war the whole society is seen as combatant and the land of the country is seen as a battlefield as a whole.

Dyadic wars are simpler in comparison to complex wars since there are only two foreign policies, sets of motives, and interactions. Dyadic wars are more prone to break out between neighbor states over territorial disputes while complex wars are more likely to exhibit<br/>complex power politics (Vasquez and Valeriano, 2010: 294-296)."
